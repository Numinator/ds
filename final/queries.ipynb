       " ('\\n\\n\\n\\nA deliciously unexpected byproduct of the November presidential election has been the unmasking of the hypocrisy and political bias of a once respected federal agency, the United States Commission on Civil Rights. In the last three years, the commission has launched partisan attacks on New York\\'s Republican mayor and Florida\\'s Republican governor. But never have the political motives of its members been more obvious than in the commission\\'s hearings on \"voting irregularities\" during the presidential election in Florida.\\n\\nIt has become an article of faith in liberal circles that the election of George W. Bush to the presidency is attributable, in some ill-defined measure, to the systematic \"disenfranchisement\" of minority voters in Florida. In January, the Civil Rights Commission opened its hearings on the issue. The hearings have thus far failed to unearth even a scintilla of credible evidence of minority \"disenfranchisement\" (ordinarily defined as the intentional denial of the right to vote). But that hasn\\'t stopped commissioners from taking cheap shots at Florida election officials and concluding -- before any report has been prepared -- that the right to vote was \"interfered with.\"\\n\\nMost Americans probably have never heard of the Civil Rights Commission. Established by Congress in 1957 as an independent fact-finding agency, the commission was charged with collecting and analyzing data regarding civil rights. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, its scholarship helped lay the groundwork for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\\n\\nBut having succeeded in convincing Congress to outlaw racial discrimination and strengthen protections for the right to vote, the commission began to recede into the background. It has no enforcement power and has long since been overshadowed by agencies that do: the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (which enforces workplace civil rights laws), the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Education (which enforces the civil rights laws that govern our schools), and the civil rights division of the Department of Justice (which prosecutes voting rights and other civil rights violations). With no significant governmental function, the commission continues to exist largely because of inertia -- and what politician is brave enough to have his name associated with the headline \"Feds Kill Civil Rights Agency\"? Despite its lack of obvious purpose, the commission retains the ability to subpoena documents and compel public testimony. The activists who today dominate the commission use this subpoena power as an instrument of agitation, to embarrass those who refuse to follow the politically correct line on racial issues.\\n\\nAlthough bipartisan by law, the commission displays a decided leftward tilt. Its eight members include four Democrats, one Republican, and three \"independents\" -- two of them appointed by Democrats, one by Republicans. In all, six of the eight were appointed by Democratic presidents or Democratic congressional leaders.\\n\\nPerhaps the commission\\'s most leftward member is its chairman, Mary Frances Berry, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a well-known practitioner of racial politics. Berry is a former Democrat who conveniently became an independent after she was named to the commission in 1980 by President Carter. When President Reagan tried to replace her in 1983, Berry sued and won a preliminary injunction barring her removal from office. Shortly thereafter, Democrats in Congress reappointed Berry to the commission, and in 1993 President Clinton elevated her to the chairmanship.\\n\\nChairman Berry wears her status as a registered independent as a badge of honor, often pointing to it as evidence of her objectivity. But neutral Berry is not. According to Federal Election Commission records, she is a regular contributor to Democratic and left-wing causes, including Keep Hope Alive (Jesse Jackson\\'s political action committee), Ralph Neas, and the campaigns of Carol Moseley-Braun, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Al Gore.\\n\\nAnother Democratic appointee, Harvard law professor Christopher Edley, is a former Clinton administration official who advised the Gore campaign. In an article published in the October 9, 2000, issue of the Nation, Edley argued that racial progress in America was \"contingent\" on Al Gore\\'s defeating George W. Bush, and he painted an alarmist picture of a Supreme Court with Bush appointees turning back the clock on civil rights.\\n\\nCommission vice chairman Cruz Reynoso is a former justice of the California Supreme Court, where he was famously removed from office by the state\\'s electorate along with then-chief justice Rose Bird. The commission\\'s other Democratic appointees include Elsie Meeks, a Native American activist from South Dakota; Yvonne Lee, a San Francisco consultant; and Victoria Wilson, a registered independent and an editor at Alfred A. Knopf.\\n\\nTo be sure, the commission is not entirely without alternative viewpoints. The lone Republican, Abigail Thernstrom, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the author of several books on race relations, was a contributor to George W. Bush\\'s presidential campaign. And commissioner Russell G. Redenbaugh, a financial consultant and a registered independent appointed by Republicans, is said to have contributed to Republican candidates. But Thernstrom was appointed only last month. She and Redenbaugh are clearly outnumbered.\\n\\nEqually significant is the make-up of the commission\\'s staff. Despite the change in administrations, four Clinton holdovers occupy important political appointments, including staff director and general counsel. Kimberly Alton, a special assistant to the staff director, took a leave of absence from the commission to work on the Gore campaign, then returned to take charge of the Florida project soon after November 7. Shortly before the change of administrations, the commission also hired Joshua Gottheimer, a Clinton White House staffer, to work on the Florida matter.\\n\\nHow the Civil Rights Commission came to investigate allegations of disenfranchisement in Florida remains something of a mystery. Sources close to the commission report that in the days following the election, Jesse Jackson telephoned his friend Mary Frances Berry to ask for the commission\\'s help. Berry responded by sending three staff attorneys to Florida. This taxpayer-funded trip was ostensibly necessary so that the commission could \"monitor developments\" to see if an investigation was warranted. But the sources believe that the attorneys were, in fact, helping Jackson and his staff drum up allegations of discrimination to help Al Gore.\\n\\nBy December, all hell had broken loose in Florida. Initial complaints that a butterfly ballot in Palm Beach County had confused elderly voters had long since morphed into allegations of more widespread \"minority disenfranchisement.\" Jesse Jackson took to the airwaves accusing election officials of joining in \"a systematic plan to disenfranchise black voters.\" In December, the commission voted to open a full-scale inquiry.\\n\\nThe first set of hearings, held on January 11 and 12 in Tallahassee, focused largely on three areas: problems with Florida\\'s voting apparatus, efforts by the state to purge convicted felons from the rolls, and allegations of voter intimidation. Using its subpoena power, the commission summoned Florida governor Jeb Bush and secretary of state Katherine Harris and demanded an explanation for the problems with Florida\\'s voting process. No sooner did the governor take his seat than it became clear the commission was more interested in using him as a political punching bag than in hearing what he had to say. Unlike all the other witnesses who testified before the commission in Tallahassee, Bush was not permitted to make an opening statement. Chairman Berry explained, \"We don\\'t have time.\"\\n\\nIn response to questioning, Governor Bush described a bipartisan task force he has appointed to identify deficiencies in Florida\\'s voting process and recommend reform. He also expressed concern about allegations that convicted felons had been allowed to vote in violation of Florida law, and that, conversely, some voters had been mistakenly identified as felons and purged from the rolls. This prompted Berry to ask sarcastically if Bush had mentioned the felon issue because he considered \"the other allegations so insubstantial that they do not merit the same kind of attention.\"\\n\\nIf the commissioners were disrespectful of the governor, they were positively rude to Harris. Berry berated Harris for what she deemed Harris\\'s failure to educate first-time voters on voting procedures and later mocked Harris\\'s testimony as \"laughable.\" Vice chairman Cruz Reynoso yelled at Harris for refusing to extend the deadline for counties to submit the results of their recounts beyond 5:00 P.M. on the date set by the Florida Supreme Court. And commissioner Victoria Wilson accused Harris of riding on \"a merry-go-round of denial.\" In addition to state officials, the commission heard from local election supervisors about mechanical problems in their counties. At one point, Berry pointedly asked whether such problems had affected African-American voters disproportionately. When one election supervisor responded that the predominantly black precincts in her county had been no more likely to experience problems than predominantly white precincts, an agitated Berry cut off the witness and launched into a tirade about the importance of testifying truthfully under oath.\\n\\nBerry, however, believes not only that minority voters disproportionately voted in areas with faulty voting machines, but that they were the victims of a deliberate plot to keep them from the polls. On January 13, Berry told CNN\\'s Brian Nelson that \"most of what happened [in Florida] was on the front end. Most of what happened to people was not even being able to get to the polls or being able to vote.\" In other words, Berry believes that somebody prevented minorities from voting in the first instance -- never mind that black voter participation in Florida rose 65 percent in this election and that blacks, who make up approximately 13 percent of Florida\\'s electorate, were 16 percent of the state\\'s voters on November 7. Unfortunately for Berry, the evidence thus far not only fails to prove her theory, it suggests the reverse -- that there was no intentional disenfranchisement in Florida.\\n\\nTake, for example, the three ordinary voters who testified at the Tallahassee hearings about their personal experiences on Election Day. The first, John Nelson, testified that he became \"suspicious\" when he saw an unmanned police cruiser parked outside two separate polling places in neighborhoods with large black populations. (At least one of the police cars, it turns out, was parked while its driver was inside voting.) Incredibly, this was Nelson\\'s only complaint.\\n\\nAnother witness, Roberta Tucker, testified that she felt intimidated when police stopped her -- along with numerous other motorists -- at a roadblock on her way to the polls in Leon County. Tucker, who is black, stated that the officer who stopped her asked to see her driver\\'s license and then sent her on her way. Tucker testified that she then proceeded to the polling place and voted.\\n\\nThe undisputed evidence is that the roadblock, which lasted 90 minutes, was a routine vehicle checkpoint located more than two miles away from any polling place. The officers manning the checkpoint issued 18 citations, 12 of them to white motorists -- hardly persuasive evidence of a scheme to intimidate non-whites. Moreover, Florida\\'s Democratic attorney general, Bob Butterworth, who also testified at the Tallahassee hearing, has found no evidence that the checkpoint was established for the purpose of denying anyone\\'s civil rights.\\n\\nIn Tallahassee, the commission also heard from an African-American minister known as Apostle Willie D. Whiting. Whiting testified that he felt \"slingshotted back to slavery\" when he learned that he had been removed from the voter rolls. As it turns out, Apostle Whiting had been mistaken for Willie J. Whiting, a convicted felon born in the same month and year as he. Ultimately, Apostle Whiting convinced poll workers that there had been a clerical error, and he testified that he was allowed to vote.\\n\\nBerry was undeterred. \"Well,\" she said, leading the witness, \"do you think an appropriate reaction to all this that happened to you was for some people -- if it happened to other people -- to decide that they just simply won\\'t try to vote again?\" Berry continued, \"I mean, if it\\'s that much of a hassle and if people are going to say you\\'re a felon when you\\'re not and you\\'re going to be embarrassed at the polls or asked for two IDs when you don\\'t need them and you don\\'t have them and nobody else is, maybe you should just stay home and not vote.\" Chairman Berry apparently sees no distinction between mere inconvenience and \"disenfranchisement.\"\\n\\nBerry is right, however, about one thing. Some Floridians were turned away from the polls. And for good reason: to prevent voter fraud. Florida\\'s constitution prohibits convicted felons from voting in the state, and a Florida statute requires each county to purge its voter lists of duplicate names, deceased voters, voters who have moved, and felons. This anti-fraud law was passed in the wake of Miami\\'s 1997 mayoral election, in which ballots were cast on behalf of dead people. Even with the new precautions, the Miami Herald reports that at least 2,000 illegal ballots were cast in Florida on November 7 by ineligible felons, unregistered voters, dead people, and people who had already voted. Most of these errors occurred because poll workers failed to check voter identification properly. Yet Berry believes that a mere request for proper identification constitutes an attempt to disenfranchise minority voters.\\n\\nTo be sure, those responsible for updating voter lists made some mistakes. And Governor Bush is right to ask his task force to recommend reforms in this area. But there is simply no evidence that any eligible voter was purged from the voting lists deliberately or that Florida\\'s voter purge law was purposely employed to disenfranchise eligible voters.\\n\\nLack of evidence, however, doesn\\'t stop Mary Frances Berry. After several state officials testified that their offices had received no complaints of discrimination, Chairman Berry announced that she viewed such testimony as proof positive that Florida officials had conspired to prevent victims of discrimination from coming forward. She explained, \"Whenever an agency . . . receives no complaints when there\\'s a bunch of stuff happening out there and it\\'s all reported in the media, that means the people who are complaining either don\\'t know you\\'re somebody to complain to or they don\\'t believe you\\'ll do anything about it. And so from our standpoint, that\\'s not a good thing, that\\'s a bad thing.\"\\n\\nAs if the Tallahassee hearings weren\\'t bad enough, on February 16, the commission returned to Florida to continue fishing for proof of a conspiracy to deprive voters of their civil rights. Convening in Miami for one day of testimony, the commission heard from additional voters who said they had encountered problems at the polls. Some of the witnesses complained about unusually long lines at their polling places. Others testified that their names had not been on the voter lists and that jammed telephone lines had prevented poll workers from confirming their identities.\\n\\nIn sum, the witnesses who testified at the Miami hearing fleshed out a picture of chaotic polling places, desperately understaffed and lacking in resources. But while the testimony provided clear evidence of governmental inefficiency, it provided no credible evidence of intentional discrimination. True to form, Chairman Berry expressed concern that voters had been \"disenfranchised\" by the failure of election officials to anticipate patterns of voter turnout and provide appropriate resources. Speaking with reporters during a lunch break on Friday, Berry stated her view that any minority who sought to vote and was unable to do so was a victim of discrimination, irrespective of the circumstances. Intent, Berry said, is not her touchstone, impact is.\\n\\nDespite her claim that the commissioners will withhold judgment until they have examined all of the evidence, Chairman Berry already knows, as she recently told CNN, that \"something very bad, awful happened during the election. . . . [The] right to vote was somehow interfered with.\" Commissioner Edley, too, seems to have preconceived notions of what happened in Florida. Indeed, like the Queen of Hearts calling for \"sentence first, verdict afterwards,\" Edley at the January 12 hearing sought a \"confession\" and an apology from Florida officials for disenfranchising minorities. So obvious was the commission\\'s bias that even the Washington Post noted it. \"Berry\\'s pointed remarks,\" wrote reporter Sue Anne Pressley, \"-- and those from some of her colleagues -- injected a tone of partisan rancor into the hearing\\'s fact finding mission.\" What Pressley did not mention is that indulgence of partisan rancor has become the commission\\'s modus operandi.\\n\\nLess than a year ago, the commission came under fire for playing politics with its investigation of alleged discrimination by the New York City Police Department -- an investigation launched just as mayor Rudy Giuliani was exploring a run for the U.S. Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton. During public hearings on the NYPD in May 1999, Berry repeatedly interrupted the mayor\\'s testimony and failed to silence hecklers. As Heather Mac Donald reported in the summer 1999 issue of City Journal, Berry refused to reprimand audience members who attempted to shout down witnesses with catcalls such as \"P.U. I smell Blue.\" And when Giuliani attempted to present data showing the NYPD\\'s low use of force in comparison to police in other major cities, Berry interrupted, demanding to know whether the NYPD \"fairly represents the population of New York City.\" In contrast to her treatment of the mayor, Berry showed great deference to New York\\'s leading race-baiter, the Reverend Al Sharpton, whose \"work\" on the issue of police brutality she praised.\\n\\nTo add insult to injury, Berry -- who in September 1999 made the first of several financial contributions to Mrs. Clinton\\'s campaign -- threatened to release the commission\\'s report early, without allowing the city an opportunity to comment privately on the draft, as required by law. Only after the mayor complained that the timing of the report\\'s release smacked of politics did the commission agree to give the city a chance to comment. Yet less than a week later, a copy of the report was leaked to the New York Times.\\n\\nThe final report, released in June 2000, was a partisan document filled with inaccuracies and distortions. For example, it lambasted the NYPD for \"racial profiling\" on the basis of raw comparisons of the percentage of minorities in the population with the percentage of minorities among people stopped. And it virtually ignored the dramatic drop in the use of deadly force by New York cops since Giuliani became mayor (down 73 percent between 1990 and 1999).\\n\\nIn a statement dissenting from the NYPD report, two members of the commission reprimanded the majority for \"manipulating the data\" and politicizing their investigation. The final report, they said, was \"a one-sided portrayal of the NYPD . . . based not on evidence, but on conjecture, opinion, and \\'perception as reality.\\'\" Amazingly, Berry\\'s allies at the commission had refused to provide the dissenting commissioners with a copy of the hearing transcript, forcing them to file a Freedom of Information Act request in order to obtain copies.\\n\\nThen, as now, Berry and her collaborators were interested not in uncovering the truth but in eliciting selective testimony to support their preconceived thesis: that Mayor Giuliani presides over a virtual army of racist oppression.\\n\\nThe commission had similar political motives for investigating the use of \"percentage plans\" in higher education in Florida, Texas, and California. All three states have attempted to eliminate racial quotas while increasing diversity through the use of plans guaranteeing that the top graduates of all state high schools are admitted to the public university system.\\n\\nThe commission rejected Jeb Bush\\'s invitation to meet with members of his administration to discuss his \"One Florida\" plan. Nevertheless, when the commission issued its report last April, Chairman Berry personally attacked Governor Bush, referring to him as \"Scrooge.\" The report disparaged the Florida plan as a \"stealth acknowledgment\" of \"existing segregation,\" and warned that the reform would cause minority college enrollment to fall dramatically in Florida. (In fact, there are now more minority students in Florida\\'s state university system than ever before.) The commission also took a swipe at Texas governor George W. Bush, already a candidate for president, referring to the \"devastating impact\" of the Texas percentage plan on black and Hispanic enrollment in graduate programs.\\n\\nThe percentage plan report was pushed through the commission on a rarely used \"poll vote\" without the standard time for deliberation and discussion by the commissioners. This tactic sparked a letter of protest from representative Charles Canady (now Jeb Bush\\'s legal counsel), who accused the commission of \"launching a partisan attack\" against the Bushes during the 2000 presidential campaign. And it prompted criticism from the conservative Center for New Black Leadership, which called the commission \"neither Civil nor Right.\"\\n\\nThe Civil Rights Commission\\'s percentage plan report, its report on the NYPD, and its investigation of the voting in Florida reveal a pattern and practice of hatchet jobs against Republicans. Fortunately, the Department of Justice and the Florida attorney general\\'s office are also investigating claims of minority \"disenfranchisement\" in the 2000 presidential election in Florida, and a bipartisan state commission is exploring ways to improve voting procedures.\\n\\nWith those more credible efforts under way, it is difficult to see the Civil Rights Commission\\'s inquiry as anything other than an attempt to rewrite the history of election 2000 under the seal of a federal agency for the purpose of undermining the presidency of George W. Bush. On the other hand, the commission\\'s report on Florida will serve a good purpose if it finally strips any remaining veneer of impartiality from the commission and provides Congress the impetus to eliminate a discredited body that long ago outlived its usefulness.\\n\\nJennifer C.

Pretending to \"question\" Li about religious freedom, Robertson volunteered that Li Hongzhi, founder of the outlawed Falun Gong meditation sect, \"was lying to the people.\" Then he asked whether Beijing\\'s ban on Falun Gong might \"ever be applied to Christianity or Buddhism or some other religion?\" Oh, no, replied Li, \"not at all. . . . This has got nothing to do with any religion because the Falun Gong is not a religion.

With a vengeance.

       " (\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAS THE WHITE HOUSE GEARS UP to promote Bill Clinton's universal prescription-drug benefit for the elderly, it seems to have learned a thing or two from its historic health-care defeat of 1994. Like that earlier plan, Clinton's promise to pay for the prescription drugs of older Americans will put health care for millions more people under the control of the federal government -- in this case, the prescriptions of nearly 40 million Medicare recipients. And like the earlier plan, the Clinton drug benefit promises better care for less money, but will inevitably end up with rationing and price controls that will degrade the quality of care available to the elderly. What's changed is that the White House is even less forth-right about the true cost and character of its health-care scheme than it was five years ago.\\n\\nThe White House is mindful of the fact that Medicare is going bankrupt, so it claims that the new drug benefit would pay for itself. It's hard to see how. For one thing, a universal drug benefit would encourage the nearly 70 percent of retirees who already have private coverage for prescription drugs to drop it in favor of the new federal entitlement. This alone would add about $ 20 billion a year to Medicare spending. Covering the 30 percent who don't already have such coverage would add another $ 10 billion or so. Even with an additional premium proposed by Clinton -- as low as $ 10 a month -- the program would hardly be self-financing.\\n\\nThat's why the White House claims that increased subsidy of drugs would lead to lower overall healthcare costs. But this, too, is exceedingly unlikely. It's true drugs can be cost-effective, but only within the context of a well-coordinated effort to manage disease. And no one mistakes Medicare for well-coordinated health care. Consider one of the most cost-effective drugs there is -- aspirin. For just pennies a day, it can lower your chances of a heart attack, yet over 25 percent of seniors fail to take the drug, even after a heart attack. Similarly, older Americans barely avail themselves of the flu and pneumonia shots that are already covered by Medicare. When you consider that Medicare now reimburses for prescription drugs for hospitalized seniors, that, moreover, most seniors already have private drug coverage, and that a government survey shows fewer than 2 percent of seniors say they have trouble getting the drugs they need, it's preposterous to think that a new prescription-drug subsidy will lower health-care costs.\\n\\nSo how will this new entitlement be paid for? Price controls, of course. Now, the White House claims talk of price controls is propaganda from the pharmaceutical companies; the government, it says, just wants the same discount drug companies now give to health-maintenance organizations (HMOs). That sounds reasonable until you realize that HMOs don't control anything like the 60 percent of all prescriptions written that the government would pay for under the Clinton plan. The federal government would then be the largest purchaser of prescription drugs in the world, and it could indeed force drug companies to lower their prices. But the high-quality, innovative medicine Americans now take for granted would be endangered.\\n\\nDemocratic populists in Congress and the White House like to rail about the profits of drug companies. Well, yes, companies in a free economy make money. And if they are in an industry that depends on new and improved products for profits, they reinvest a lot of what they make. If the White House were to propose federal control of 60 percent of the telecommunications or high-technology sectors of the economy, the idea would rightly be rejected outright because it would kill innovation. But somehow the administration keeps a straight face when it proposes controlling most of the pharmaceutical market and says that such a plan won't hurt biomedical innovation.\\n\\nThere are further perversities that would flow from price controls. Seniors would likely be forced to use only the drugs the government wanted them to have. While the Clinton White House brags that private firms would administer the drug benefit, the list of drugs available -- as well as how and when -- would be dictated by Medicare bureaucrats. The potentially harmful outcomes of such rationing can be seen with drugs that Medicare already covers.\\n\\nThere is, for instance, the sadly instructive saga of erythropoietin (EPO), a biotechnology product used to reduce the anemia that people suffer when they go through kidney dialysis. Dialysis patients on EPO are healthier and live longer than those without it. In 1993, in an effort to contain the cost of EPO, Medicare did three things: It put a price control on the drug, rationed the amount patients could get, and refused to reimburse its use for patients above a certain level of healthy blood cells. Under the Medicare protocol, the number of people who died increased and people with healthy blood levels wound up getting sicker. It took five years of lobbying and administrative review to get Medicare to loosen its EPO controls. If the Clinton drug benefit is adopted, it will simply extend Medicare's mishandling of drug benefits to all prescriptions.\\n\\nThere is also the phenomenon Duke economist Henry Grabowski calls the social drug lag -- thanks to price caps, seniors would be last in receiving access to new medications. Negotiations with the government over prices could delay the access of seniors to most innovative medicines for years or -- if the government blacklists a company that refuses to budge -- forever.\\n\\nFinally, no amount of populist rhetoric alters the fact that the Clinton plan will mainly benefit the well-off. Nearly 50 percent of seniors have family incomes of $ 25,000 or more and spend less than one percent of their income on drugs. Hence the Clinton plan will create an entitlement that will largely go to a group who can afford their drugs and their drug coverage.\\n\\nLike the Health Security Act of 1994, the Clinton drug plan should be scrapped. It may seem like a panacea. But it is really a poison pill that seniors and non-seniors alike should avoid.\\n\\nRobert M.

       " ('\\n\\n\\n\\nAt first blush, the Republican presidential field doesn\\'t exactly overflow with new ideas. Steve Forbes updates the free-market policies and themes of Jack Kemp\\'s 1988 campaign. Gary Bauer\\'s campaign echoes the social conservatism of Pat Robertson\\'s 1988 run. Elizabeth Dole reprises the Main Street Republicanism of Bob Dole\\'s 1988 and 1996 efforts. And Pat Buchanan recycles the working-class populism of his own 1992 and 1996 campaigns.\\n\\nNonetheless, alongside these well-established lines of Republican thought, there are two newer approaches struggling to break through. If you listen carefully, you discover George W. Bush and John McCain are running campaigns that sound unlike any others in recent GOP history. The candidates themselves don\\'t seem fully aware of the implications of what they are saying, but together, Bush\\'s Compassionate Conservatism and McCain\\'s New Patriotic Challenge are steps toward a fresh vision for the Republican party. Indeed, if you meld the core messages of the two campaigns, you get a coherent governing philosophy for the post-Clinton age.\\n\\nThe free marketeers and the religious conservatives have been singing their tunes for a while. But the Bush and McCain campaigns emerged in response to the events of the 1990s: the rise of Third Way triangulators on the Democratic side, the waning salience of the culture war (as revealed, for example, by the public\\'s tolerance of the Lewinsky scandal), and the collapse of the Gingrich revolution. That means they are new in tone as well as substance. The older conservative strains were formed in an era of liberal dominance. Conservatives were reacting against the growing welfare state and the liberationist movements of the 1960s. The older conservative strains, therefore, have a confrontationalist mentality: Polarize the debate, attack the liberal elites. But in the 1990s, liberalism is no longer dominant; the sixties is something that happened a generation ago. This decade has been a period of ideological mush and muddle. So temperamentally, the new conservative approaches are not as confrontational as the old ones.\\n\\nThe new strains reflect a much less polarized view of the role of government. In the era when liberal social programs were on the march, Ronald Reagan could say that government was the problem, and in 1995 Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey echoed that view. But welfare reform is the biggest domestic policy development of this decade, championed by people like Republican governors John Engler and Tommy Thompson, so social policy no longer looks so menacing. Both Bush and McCain criticize the excessive anti-government zeal of the 1995 congressional Republicans. George W. Bush recently attacked \"the destructive mindset: the idea that if government would only get out of our way, all our problems would be solved. An approach with no higher goal, no nobler purpose than \\'Leave us Alone.\\'\" That phrase -- that government should \"Leave Us Alone\" -- was the rallying cry of the Gingrich revolutionaries. Meanwhile, John McCain notes that a \"healthy skepticism\" about government has turned into \"widespread cynicism bordering on alienation.\" Instead of telling people that government is evil, McCain reminds them that public service is \"the highest calling.\"\\n\\nBoth Bush and McCain believe in conservativegovernance. Both seek to use government in circumscribed but energetic ways. \"Government must be carefully limited, but strong and active,\" Bush says. The two candidates, however, emphasize activism in different spheres. George W. Bush seeks to restore the power of local and intimate authority -- the authority of parents, neighborhood, charity, and local government. Bush says the next task of welfare reform is to build up the religious and community institutions that can touch people on the profoundest level. Bush vows to dedicate $ 8 billion in his first year in office to expand tax incentives for charitable giving, increase drug treatment, federally fund after-school programs run by community groups, establish \"Second Chance\" homes for unwed teenage mothers, and offer federal grants for private anti-poverty efforts -- an activist agenda. Furthermore, he wants to use government to target specific areas of need. He calls for programs to aid the 1.3 million American children who have a parent in prison.\\n\\nIf Bush fails to fully develop his Compassionate Conservatism, it may degenerate into a tepid form of noblesse oblige: a few tax breaks so that rich people will give a little more money to help poor people, a lot of gauzy, Thousand Points of Light rhetoric. Two leaders of the civil society movement, the Bradley Foundation\\'s Michael Joyce and William Schambra, highlighted this danger in a memo to Bush adviser and Indianapolis mayor Steve Goldsmith last winter. \"It conjures up readily for its critics a kind of foolish, mushy, sentimental soft-heartedness that suggests a readiness to return to the days of well-intentioned government hand-outs, which made the giver feel good but did little for, and even harmed, the recipient.\"\\n\\nAlready, Compassionate Conservatism points toward something much more radical: an across-the-board effort to revive responsible citizenship. Conservatives have not worried much about the decline of citizenship over the last few decades. With their bias in favor of private-sector activity and against public-sector activity, many conservatives have even looked benignly on the decline in voting rates. It\\'s a good thing many people aren\\'t voting, conservatives argued; it shows their lives are not overpoliticized.\\n\\nBut in the 1990s, the danger is that America might become underpoliticized. People might withdraw into the private contentment of their lustrous McMansions -- which would be bad not only for those left out of the current prosperity, but for the McMansion dwellers as well. Active citizenship, Tocqueville observed, inculcates certain virtues that are necessary to any great democratic nation. Getting involved in public and political endeavors forces people to develop broader judgment, sacrifice for the greater good, hear the call of duty, and stand up for their beliefs. In other words, the promise of a fully realized Compassionate Conservatism is not merely that Faith Based Foundation X has a higher success rate than Public Welfare Agency Y. It is that working for the general good through voluntary organizations -- instead of leaving such functions to professional state agencies -- gives people the opportunity to govern themselves. School choice doesn\\'t just yield higher test scores. It is also good for parents, because it gets them involved in running their kids\\' education, rather than surrendering that responsibility to bureaucrats.\\n\\nBush seems to realize this. In an education speech in Los Angeles on September 2, Bush argued that state governments should play an active role in setting out standards and tests. \"We test because informed parents become more involved,\" Bush declared. Further, he suggested that Title I money should be made available to parents who have children in failing schools. They could take this money, up to $ 1,500, and spend it on tutoring, on private school tuition, or to transfer to a better public school -- whatever they choose. The emerging theme is clear: The modern bureaucratic welfare state weakens citizenship. Compassionate Conservatism will mean something to the extent that it renews citizenship and rejuvenates self-government.\\n\\nAnother problem with Compassionate Conservatism is that it is so modest. It might be an adequate governing idea in Switzerland or Colombia or Canada. But America is not like those countries; it is the world\\'s leading power as well as the world\\'s exceptional nation. When Edmund Burke praised the \"little platoons\" of neighborhood and town, he said they were merely \"the first link in the series by which we proceed toward a love to our country and to mankind.\" A person running for the presidency of the United States of America can\\'t be content to be alderman or even governor to the nation. He has to possess a governing philosophy that connects citizens to higher national aims and that organizes American behavior around the world.\\n\\nThis is where John McCain\\'s campaign makes its contribution. If the Bush campaign promotes limited but energetic government on the local level, the McCain campaign has articulated a philosophy of limited but energetic government on the national and global level.\\n\\nThe core speech of the McCain campaign was delivered at the Johns Hopkins University commencement last spring. \"The threat that concerns me is the pervasive public cynicism that is debilitating our democracy,\" McCain declared. Skepticism about government, he continued, has turned into a biting contempt for public life. And this cynicism doesn\\'t lead people to want to scale back government, as many Republicans used to believe. Instead, it just causes them to detach themselves from public life and active citizenship. Cynics look on outrageous scandals that disgrace our democracy with bemused detachment. Standing aloof and considering themselves superior, they oppose change of any kind, even efforts to reform or cut back the very things that disgust them. The only politics they respond to is Bill Clinton-Dick Morris-style maneuvering, which is petty and sentimental on the surface but corrupt and selfish at its core.\\n\\n\"Now we have a new patriotic challenge for a new century: declaring war on the cynicism that threatens our public institutions, our culture, and, ultimately, our private happiness,\" McCain said at Johns Hopkins.\\n\\nThe first task, he continued, is to reform the institutions that no longer make us proud. McCain is unabashed about his support for campaign-finance reform, feeling that government can never inspire public confidence as long as politicians are caught up in the money chase. He proposed reforming the Social Security trust fund by taking it off budget so Congress can\\'t raid it. He proposed reforming the tax code, to reduce the loopholes that reward corporate donors. In August, he lambasted his fellow Republicans for larding their tax bill with special breaks for favored donors.\\n\\n\"We need to be a little less content,\" he continued at Johns Hopkins. \"We need to get riled up a bit.\" In a speech in Kansas earlier in the spring, he matched his reform activism at home with his own brand of democratic activism abroad. Other candidates sometimes seem to pretend that America is not the world\\'s sole superpower. They treat American supremacy as something that will go away if you ignore it long enough. And in this they are right. But McCain embraces American might, believing that it gives us the opportunity to better promote our interests, roll back rogue nations, preserve international order, and advance the cause of democratic self-government around the world. As he demonstrated during the Kosovo crisis, McCain, more than any of the other Republican presidential candidates, believes in using American military might to advance America\\'s democratic ideals and punish outrageous dictators who threaten peace.\\n\\nThe danger in McCain\\'s New Patriotic Challenge is that it might dissolve into a sour Ross Perot-style reform effort, motivated more by populist resentment than by a genuine effort to restore luster to public life. And the second flaw is that it may be a little too grand. For better or worse, the American people this decade are primarily interested in restoring local authority and reestablishing the intimate structures that have been torn by the social disruptions of the past quarter century. The McCain campaign speaks confidently about global affairs and reform on the national level, but it speaks less confidently than the Bush campaign about repairing the fabric of family and local community. It risks being out of step with a nation that, at this moment, distrusts grand talk and grand projects.\\n\\nIn the political arena, George W. Bush and John McCain are now rivals. But if you look at their policy agendas, you quickly realize that theirs are complementary visions. One primarily addresses the needs of the family and community, and the other the needs of the nation and the world. But they share the traditional conservative belief in responsible citizenship, uniting Americans. Both defend politics and civic activity from the tide of anti-political fervor that is sweeping the country. Together, they make a coherent vision, which might be called One Nation Conservatism.\\n\\nThat phrase has been used elsewhere with various meanings. But it is apt here. In his speech on Compassionate Conservatism, George Bush went out of his way to remind his listeners that we have a duty to assist those left behind by the current prosperity because all of us are part of the same nation. \"These are not strangers,\" he said. \"They are citizens, Americans, our brothers and sisters.\" Bush is right to imply that in an era of decentralization and market segmentation, America risks dividing along class, cultural, and ethnic lines into tribes, each with its own parochialisms, problems, and affirmative-action sinecures.\\n\\nAnd John McCain is right to remind us that it is our public institutions that bind us together. We Americans did not become one nation because our ancestors were once members of the same tribe or kingdom, or because we have some blood-and-sweat connection to this soil. We are united by the Declaration and the Constitution of the American Founders. We are united by the system of government they established and the ideals it embodies -- so how can we love our country if we hate its government? McCain hopes to restore confidence in that system of government, both at home and abroad.\\n\\nIf you follow these two campaigns to their logical conclusion, you arrive at a One Nation Conservatism that marries community goodness with national greatness. It starts with a series of proposals to eliminate the chunks of the modern welfare state that smothered civic activism. It replaces that old system with something else: a burbling civic life. It accomplishes this through education vouchers, seed grants for charter schools, charitable tax credits, grants to religious and other institutions, Social Security privatization -- all of which encourage people to govern themselves.\\n\\nThen it restores faith in government with an aggressive reform agenda: banning \"soft money\" from election campaigns, revamping welfare-state programs such as Medicare to give citizens more control over their lives, simplifying the tax code, and cutting corporate pork in order to give citizens the sense that the government works for them, rather than for the corporate titans with the best lobbyists.\\n\\nIt champions a series of measures designed to remind American citizens of their common bonds. It revitalizes our transportation network, which has always bound us together. It nourishes the parks, forests, and preserves that are our common heritage. It reforms the nation\\'s culture policy, so that museums and arts institutions that accept taxpayer dollars are more likely to explore what it means to be American than they are to nourish alienation and multicultural parochialism.\\n\\nFinally, it promotes an energetic foreign policy -- because Americans will never devote themselves to democratic self-government at home if they do not see themselves ardently championing democratic self-government abroad.\\n\\nNo party is worth supporting if its goals are wholly negative, just cutting and dismantling institutions. No party is worth supporting if it cannot distinguish the parts of the state that foster self-government from those that crush it. And no party is worth supporting if it is wholly materialistic; if it seems to be interested in nothing more than building up its supporters\\' bank accounts. The Republican party may be learning this. It may be on the verge of absorbing the lessons of its recent mistakes. Out of the present quiet and seemingly nonideological presidential campaign, there may emerge a vigorous One Nation Conservatism that will connect a revived sense of citizenship with the long-standing national greatness Americans hold dear.\\n\\nDavid Brooks is a senior editor of THE WEEKLY STANDARD.',\n",

       " ('\\n\\n\\n\\nFIVE STRAIGHTFORWARD IDEAS\\n\\n\\n\\n1. MOVE ELECTIONS TO SATURDAY (OR SUNDAY) 2. OPEN PRIMARIES 3. END GERRYMANDERING 4. BRING BACK & ENCOURAGE THE SMALL DONOR 5. TERM LIMITS FOR THE SUPREME COURT\\n\\nAt the outset let me say that these ideas were put forth in an insightful November 4th NYT column by Op-Ed writer Joe Nocera; although he rightly acknowledges they were not his ideas alone …. he more or less smartly summarized them in his column. I entreat you most heartily to take a moment and read his column reference the link provided below. I truly believe with insight and understanding we can together make our country a better place — fair for all of us.\\n\\nFirst, \\'MOVE ELECTIONS TO SATURDAY (OR SUNDAY)\\' versus Tuesday; there is no logical reason to hold elections during the middle of the week. Yes, unfortunately, this is the way we do it now; and there were reasons why it began (basically religious reasons, which Nocera reviews in his Op-Ed). But those reasons do not exist today to justify continuing—it doesn’t have to be. Some refer to it as being traditional. However, in that regard Thomas Paine observantly noted that, \"A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it a superficial appearance of being right, and raises at first a formidable outcry in defense of the custom. But the tumult soon subsides. Time makes more converts than reason.\" It’s time to change to Saturday!\\n\\nOf the remaining four ideas, 2 & 3 are quite straightforward, and they may defy one’s imagination as to why they haven’t already been put into effect; well actually they have. In California and several other states they’ve begun what is known as ‘OPEN PRIMARIES’. Simply, there are ‘not’ primaries for different political parties; there’s only ‘one’ primary and it’s open to all. You may wonder how it could possibly work. Well, it does! Having participated in several open primaries, I can attest that it works astonishingly well. Its results weed out the extreme candidates, like those from the T-party. It presents the voter with a broad section of moderate candidates from which to choose—individuals more likely to govern from the center, work across party lines, and more fully represent the truer views of the entire electorate versus a small swath of extremists.\\n\\nWith respect to ending \\'GERRYMANDERING\\', California has again shown the way by forming an independent body that redraws voting districts to better reflect views of entire communities and not those of a select few. Many are unaware that in the last election Republicans won fewer votes nationally, but gained more seats in the congress than democrats. Why? It was due to flagrant \\'gerrymandering\\' by republicans after they overwhelmingly won in 2010—their so-called ‘mandate’. How could they do this is another story. However, clearly perfidious, \\'gerrymandering\\' is antidemocratic; it’s rigging the system so the results turn out in your party’s favor even though it’s not in any way reflective of how the population actually voted!\\n\\nThe last two (4 & 5) — ‘BRING BACK & ENCOURAGE THE SMALL DONOR’ — New York City has shown how the small donor can matter, and it encourages small donor donations by matching them 6 to 1; so a small $100 donation can become $600. Lastly, the ‘SUPREME COURT TERM LIMITS’— will be the hardest of all; and these two ‘donations & the justices’ are obviously intertwined. We all recognize that large amounts of cash, much of it crazily secret money, is warping our democratic process—and it is literally killing our democracy*; and, of course, we have the Supreme Court’s ‘Citizens United’ decision for almost singularly creating this national nightmare. These Supreme Court jurists should not be given lifetime tenure—it’s illogical to do so. These nine people are not gods and should not be allowed to have life and death control over us for their and our entire lives. We have clearly seen this destructive bent in the Roberts’ court with its extremely partisan right-wing agenda—they are the most conservative jurists in our history. They do not represent the consensus of American thought and they should not stand in judgment for an entire lifetime.\\n\\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/...\\n\\n*As a side-note I’m using the term ‘democracy’ loosely, for it’s important to understand that the United States is not, and has never been, a democracy—and rightly so. From its inception our country was established by the founding fathers as a constitutional republic; more fully, in a technical sense, we’re a ‘Constitutionally Limited Representative Democratic Republic’. If you’re not versed in the difference between the two — Democracy vs. Constitutional Republic — then I would direct you to the following website, which will more fully elucidate the subject:\\n\\nhttp://www.thomhartmann.com/...\\n\\nIn brief, a democracy is simply where the majority rules; while in a constitutional republic the rights of the minority are protected against the majority by rule of law.\\n\\nIn addition, I’ve included a 4 minute plus video which might also be helpful in giving you a clearer understanding of the differences between them.\\n\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/...\\n\\n',\n",

Terrorist Attacks - Sandy Rios of the American Family Association claims that Marriage Equality will bring Terrorist Attacks against America, because you know the hateful God they espouse will want revenge because America is treating LGBT people just a little more equally.\\n\\nThe garbage coming from these radical bigots is just never-ending.

And I still can\\'t get over the fact that Yoo is a Berkeley professor. Berkeley.\\n\\nJohn Yoo to Rand Paul: Leave Barack Obama Alone on Targeted Killing! John Yoo, the author of the Bush administration legal memos justifying the use of torture, thinks President Obama is really getting too much grief over targeted killing. And he wants Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.)—who filibustered Obama\\'s nominee to head the CIA for 13 hours on Wednesday—to lay off. \"I admire libertarians but I think Rand Paul\\'s filibuster in many ways is very much what libertarians do, they make these very symbolic gestures, standing for some extreme position,\" said Yoo, now a UC Berkeley law professor, who once suggested it was okay for the president to order a child\\'s testicles be crushed. [...]\\n\\nAll Work and No Pay: The Great Speedup\\n\\nYou: doing more with less. Corporate profits: going strong. The dirty secret of the jobless recovery. Webster\\'s defines speedup as \"an employer\\'s demand for accelerated output without increased pay,\" and it used to be a household word. Bosses would speed up the line to fill a big order, to goose profits, or to punish a restive workforce. Workers recognized it, unions (remember those?) watched for and negotiated over it—and, if necessary, walked out over it. But now we no longer even acknowledge it—not in blue-collar work, not in white-collar or pink-collar work, not in economics texts, and certainly not in the media (except when journalists gripe about the staff-compacted-job-expanded newsroom). Now the word we use is \"productivity,\" a term insidious in both its usage and creep. The not-so-subtle implication is always: Don\\'t you want to be a productive member of society? Pundits across the political spectrum revel in the fact that US productivity (a.k.a. economic output per hour worked) consistently leads the world. Yes, year after year, Americans wring even more value out of each minute on the job than we did the year before. U-S-A! U-S-A! Except what\\'s good for American business isn\\'t necessarily good for Americans. We\\'re not just working smarter, but harder. And harder. And harder, to the point where the driver is no longer American industriousness, but something much more predatory.\\n\\nThe Washington Post is Wrong on Keystone XL The day after the Washington Post announced it was moving its top environmental reporter off the green beat to cover politics at the White House, this op-ed went up toeing an uncomfortably familiar line: by speaking out against the Keystone XL pipeline, environmentalists are “missing the climate-endangered forest for the trees.” Leaving aside for a moment the uncomfortable irony of being reprimanded for missing the big fight by an outlet that is reshuffling focus on that very front: the editorial board, respectfully, is wrong. Not that it doesn’t have a point, but that point is concrete and incremental – and misses the entire meaning of the forest of protests over the last 18 months. The implication in the Post’s headline is that they’re in this fight, too – that we should all be focusing on better efforts for environmental protection. But missing from the piece is to what end. Instead, they settle for referencing the State Department’s recent, controversial draft review of the pipeline proposal in reciting a list of reasons why the pipeline is not a big deal, and dismiss the protests against it as nothing more than “knee-jerk” “distractions”.\\n\\nThis is America, Now: The Dow Hits a Record High With Household Income at a Decade Low\\n\\nStocks surpassed the nominal record set in 2007, while the last recorded real median US household income was 8% lower than its 2007 peak.\\n\\nTwo Drug Busts Made the FBI Think Insane Clown Posse Fans Were a Gang Threat The agent proposed an investigative plan to use “a variety of lawful methods” to learn more about the gang activities of the Juggalos. ‘[I]nvestigators must start with and work at length at street-level drug purchases of smaller amounts of drugs, surveillance, gang member debriefs, witness debriefs, confidential human source recruitment, and other traditional or non-sophisticated techniques,” the agent wrote. The Salt Lake City office informed the central Washington bureau of the investigation. Seven months later, the FBI’s nationwide gang task force warned that, among other fears, “social networking websites are a popular conveyance for Juggalo sub-culture to communicate and expand.” And yet the FBI couldn’t pin so much as a shoplifted Faygo on the Juggalos. On May 4, 2012, the Salt Lake City division “recommended the captioned cases be closed.” Next to “outlaw motorcycle gangs” “Surenos Gang Sets” and “Nortenos Blood Gang Sets”: “Juggalos.” It remains to be seen if the FBI will continue to warn of a gang threat from the Juggalos. But the Insane Clown Posse actually sued, fruitlessly, to get the bureau to disclose the basis for investigating its fans.\\n\\nReturn of the Borg: How Twitter Rebuilt Google’s Secret Weapon This software system is called Borg, and it’s one of the best-kept secrets of Google’s rapid evolution into the most dominant force on the web. Wilkes won’t even call it Borg. “I prefer to call it the system that will not be named,” he says. But he will tell us that Google has been using the system for a good nine or 10 years and that he and his team are now building a new version of the tool, codenamed Omega.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nAt Twitter, a small team of engineers has built a similar system using a software platform originally developed by researchers at the University of California at Berkeley. Known as Mesos, this software platform is open source — meaning it’s freely available to anyone — and it’s gradually spreading to other operations as well.\\n\\nHow ‘Indie’ Capitalism Will Replace Our Stagnant Economic System Efficient market theory has fostered an economic system that, over the past two decades, has generated little innovation among most companies, weakened the middle class, widened inequality, and led to the relative decline of the United States. We need to trade in an economics of efficiency for an economics of creativity. We should be moving away from a model of economics based on the “culture of control” toward a new model that embraces a “culture of chance.” Which presents the question: What do we need instead? What model can replace financial capitalism? We’re beginning to see evidence of what I call Indie Capitalism. My use of the word “indie” is deliberate. “Indie” reflects an economy that is independent of the prevailing orthodoxies of economic theory and big business. It shares many of the distributive and social structures of the independent music scene, which shuns big promoters and labels. And as happens with many bands, so many of today’s successful creative endeavors began as local phenomena before branching out to new locations and networks.\\n\\nWhy Bin Laden’s Son-In-Law is in New York City, Not Gitmo By law, Abu Ghaith should have been transferred to military detention under the provisions of the Fiscal Year 2012 National Defense Authorization Act, which requires all members of al Qaeda or associated forces to be taken into military custody at least temporarily. But the NDAA provides a wide carve out for the commander-in-chief’s discretion in war time. And the President is authorized to waive the requirement entirely if he certifies to Congress that end-running the law is in the national security interests of the United States. Several senior administration officials tell TIME Obama exercised the waiver in Abu Ghaith’s case after consulting his top aides, opting to send Ghaith to trial in the Southern District of New York rather than to Gitmo. “The President’s national security team – including the Defense Department and members of the Intelligence Community, the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, and the Department of Justice – unanimously agreed that prosecution of Ghaith in federal court will best protect the national security interests of the United States,” one senior official said.\\n\\n\\n\\nGuardian Lays Out Details of How Petraeus Organized Death Squads in Iraq The most disgusting aspect of this apparent “trial balloon” floated by the Bush administration is that the program quite possibly was already underway when the Newsweek article came out. The Guardian article reminds us that Petraeus, the architect of this program, was sent to Iraq in June of 2004 (this was his second deployment to Iraq) to begin training Iraqis, and the Newsweek article wasn’t published until January of 2005. Steele, who was reporting directly to Rumsfeld, first went to Iraq in 2003 (Rumsfeld delighted in running his own people separately from the chain of command; he did this at times with McChrystal as well). More evidence that the program was entirely intentional comes from the role of torture in the program and the moves the US made to ignore torture just as the program was put into place. A little over two years ago, the Guardian analyzed a number of documents from Wikileaks and assembled a huge number of reports of torture carried out by the militias the US trained and supported under this program. Most devastating within this cache of information, however, is that the US issued an order to ignore reports of torture carried out by these Iraqi groups.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nHere’s a video the Guardian put together in 2010 based on what they found in the Wikileaks documents and other investigations: The Torture Trail: What did General Petraeus\\'s special advisor, James Steele, know?\\n\\n\\n\\nJack White on the Mississippi blues artists: \\'They changed the world\\'\\n\\nJack White learned his craft listening to the blues legends of the 20s and 30s on albums released by a tiny Scottish label. And now he\\'s rereleasing Document Records\\' archive on vinyl It was shortly before Christmas when Gary Atkinkson met Jack White just after the latter came off stage at the Winter Gardens in Blackpool. Atkinson runs vintage-blues reissue label Document Records with his wife Gillian in Galloway, south-west Scotland. He and White, whose most recent album was a UK and US No 1, had previously corresponded by telephone and email, but Atkinson fretted that, in the flesh, White might be \"one of those shy, Prince types, who recoil at every comment\". So when the former White Stripe bounded across the room and hugged him, he was taken aback.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nWhite is still in awe of the process by which events came together in America\\'s deep south to create the blues. There was the Great Depression, the technology of recording music and the fact that furniture makers had started making record players, and needed something people could play on them. So they started recording the poor black singer-guitarists that were emerging in the Mississippi Delta. \"Something magical just occurred to create a moment in history that changed the world.\"\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nThe process by which this weird, wonderful music from the delta ended up in Scotland is a story in itself. Document was originally started in Vienna in 1986 by jazz and blues fan Johnny Parth, an Austrian who had first heard Mississippi blues when American GIs brought the records to Europe during the second world war. Atkinson, meanwhile, was a screen printer in Hull who reviewed records in his spare time. One day, he was given a set of Document CDs to review. \"I absolutely thrashed them,\" he chuckles when we meet in a Manchester cafe. \"But then I got another batch and realised this Johnny guy was on a mission from God.\"\\n\\nWhy do we need to learn the same lessons over and over again?

       " ('\\n\\n\\n\\nIN AUGUST 1986, Life magazine published a short profile of a precocious 29-year-old Democratic fund-raiser named Terry McAuliffe. It described McAuliffe as specializing in a \"zany mix of sledgehammer persistence and personal magnetism,\" and it illustrated the point with an account of how he once wrestled an alligator in order to get the Seminole Indians of Florida to fork over a $ 15,000 contribution. Conveniently, a photo of McAuliffe in action found its way of Life\\'s photo department.\\n\\nThe episode has become a staple of McAuliffe profiles written as he\\'s ascended through Democratic politics. But omitted from these write-ups has been any reference to the letter Life subsequently published from a reader who had scrutinized the photograph. The alligator, far from being dangerous, had had its mouth tied shut, rendering it \"as dangerous as a three-month old kitten.\" The reader observed, \"If McAuliffe wrestled with anything, it must have been his conscience, and his conscience lost.\"\\n\\nNow that McAuliffe is slated to become chairman of the Democratic National Committee, this anecdote nicely captures what\\'s likely to be the upside, and the downside, of his leadership. He will remain dogged in the pursuit of campaign contributions (it\\'s noteworthy that as long ago as 1986 he was hitting up groups, like Indian tribes, who probably had no business making political donations). But in this pursuit he\\'s destined to employ tactics that, like the tying up of the gator, violate the spirit of the game.\\n\\nJust ask those who have studied his now legendary fundraising tactics for Bill Clinton\\'s 1996 reelection effort. McAuliffe was the first to urge stepping up the use of White House hospitality, including the renting of the Lincoln Bedroom, as a lure to donors. One longtime advocate for campaign-finance reform of the McCain/Feingold variety, asked to assess the choice of McAuliffe to run the DNC, replied, \"He single-handedly destroyed campaign-finance law in the United States.\"\\n\\nIt might seem odd to have a figure like McAuliffe lead a party whose elected officials almost unanimously support doing away with the fund-raising practices he helped pioneer. But don\\'t expect much bellyaching from them, at least not in public. Distasteful though he may be, \"the Macker,\" as he calls himself, is drooled over by party leaders. Al Gore, in a speech last May, made clear why. McAuliffe, he said, is \"the greatest fund-raiser in the history of the universe.\"\\n\\nGore had it right. McAuliffe has set all sorts of records for fund-raising, like the gala in Washington\\'s MCI Center last May that netted $ 26.5 million in a single night, but the best way to measure his effectiveness is to take note of how other leading Democrats treat him. Richard Gephardt, a man not known for being warm and cuddly, once bought a golden retriever puppy, had it house-trained, and then personally presented it to McAuliffe on Christmas day, according to Fortune. A few years ago, Gore lobbied McAuliffe to accept the chairmanship of the DNC, and when he refused, Gore resorted to lobbying his wife. As for Clinton, he offered McAuliffe one of the most highly sought-after ambassadorships, Great Britain, even though McAuliffe\\'s foreign-policy experience is said to be limited to owning an Irish bar in Washington, D.C.\\n\\nMcAuliffe declined the London posting in order to assist Al Gore\\'s fledgling presidential campaign, but Clinton still found a way to pay his golfing buddy back. Within 48 hours of Gore\\'s concession to George W. Bush, Clinton had put out the word that McAuliffe was going to be the next DNC chairman (Clinton\\'s gratitude stems in no small part from McAuliffe\\'s having raised $ 300 million in recent years for various Clinton causes). Bill Richardson, who wanted to run, and whose service as Clinton\\'s bagman on numerous issues would seem to have earned him the right to run, was told in plain language to forget it. But Maynard Jackson, the former mayor of Atlanta, decided late last week to challenge McAuliffe, saying, \"I don\\'t think we can be so preoccupied with money that we forget about the grass-roots.\"\\n\\nMcAuliffe\\'s expected accession guarantees Clinton will remain an active figure in Democratic politics. It\\'s also an early indicator of just how primed Democrats are to win congressional majorities two years from now, and to take back the White House in 2004. For if there\\'s one thing McAuliffe will deliver as party chairman, it\\'s money, and lots of it. Indeed, there\\'s little doubt that with McAuliffe at the helm the DNC will, over the next few years, raise more money than ever before, even without the benefit of the Lincoln bedroom.\\n\\nThat will win him plaudits from Democrats. So will his expected willingness to accept a role that\\'s relatively narrow. After the harrowing experience with Ed Rendell, the recently departed party chairman who committed a gaffe nearly every time he spoke, leading Democrats will be happy with McAuliffe if he functions as nothing more than a full-time fund-raiser. Mike McCurry, a former Clinton spokesman and an enthusiastic McAuliffe backer, thinks his friend will be content with this role: \"He is more on the schmooze side than the substance side of politics.\"\\n\\nBut Democrats can only keep their fingers crossed and hope that the thin ice on which McAuliffe skates never caves in. Over the past decade he\\'s been mixed up in a number of complicated business deals that have attracted the scrutiny of federal investigators. Republicans are likely to intensify the scrutiny of McAuliffe; a leading Republican strategist told me, \"Choosing him is very risky. There\\'s so much attached to him that something is bound to blow up.\" McAuliffe naturally professes total innocence -- he once told Business Week, \"The worst thing I\\'ve ever gotten is a speeding ticket.\" One of those who vouch for him is his fund-raising mentor, Tony Coelho, the former congressman who temporarily chaired Gore\\'s presidential campaign. (\"He\\'s about as honest as they come,\" Coelho once told reporter Tim Burger.) But given Coelho\\'s own checkered past, praise from him for honesty is a bit like praise from Madonna for modesty.\\n\\nThose potential problems notwithstanding, McAuliffe would seem to be well positioned to have a successful chairmanship. In the aftermath of the Florida election controversy, Democratic voters are infinitely more hyped up than they otherwise would be after losing a presidential election. And their party is poised to win majorities in the House and Senate two years from now, for which McAuliffe will inevitably get a chunk of credit. He may even help prevent an excessively divisive presidential nominating process in 2004, given his clout within the party -- not to mention his experience wrestling alligators.\\n\\nMatthew Rees is a staff writer at THE WEEKLY STANDARD.',\n",

Our town was where Will Rogers owned a private polo field and Marion Davies relaxed in a vast beach house down on the Pacific Palisades.\\n\\nUnless you\\'re a Citizen Kane fan, you can\\'t be counted on to remember Marion Davies or the rest of this crowd. According to David Wallace, author of Lost Hollywood, the Davies character in the movie is a nasty caricature of \"one of Hollywood\\'s least mean-spirited personalities. As well as one of its most generous.\" But you\\'re not expected to remember the culture of yesteryear unless it\\'s exhumed by someone like Ken Burns. Which is where Wallace\\'s nostalgia adventure comes in. It\\'s a treasury of Hollywood memorabilia along the lines of Nathan Silver\\'s recently reissued Lost New York.\\n\\nSilver\\'s book is a jaw-dropping look at the city\\'s vanished landmarks. The venality prize for destroying irreplaceable architecture has got to be a tie: One winner is the Metropolitan Opera Association, which ordered the demolition of its historic 39th Street Opera House, lest it be used to compete with the association\\'s new plant at Lincoln Center. The other winner is the president of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, who supplied an epitaph to the destruction of Penn Station when he wrote a letter to the New York Times asking, \"Does it make sense to preserve a building merely as a \\'monument\\'?\"\\n\\nLike Silver, Wallace uses architecture as a springboard for memory, as when he discusses a celebrated hotel named The Garden of Alla, after its owner, the silent film star Alla Nazimova. (A subsequent proprietor changed the spelling to \"Allah,\" to Nazimova\\'s everlasting annoyance.) Alla\\'s Garden was not in the same architectural league as New York\\'s great lost monuments like the Ritz or the Astor. It consisted of two dozen stucco bungalows surrounding an eight room house at the end of Sunset Boulevard. What was noteworthy was not the layout, but the residents.\\n\\nWhen Nazimova opened her hotel, she threw \"a gigantic eighteen-hour party.\" And when it closed, a generation later, she gave a party for 350, at which more than a thousand materialized. Between galas, the Garden of Alla(h) gave food and lodging to F. Scott Fitzgerald, Margaret Sullavan, Carole Lombard, Humphrey Bogart, William Powell, and a celebrity register of thousands. William Faulkner wanted to stay there while doing time as a screenwriter. But he couldn\\'t afford it. The place featured one of the first swimming pools to be lit underwater. From which Tallulah Bankhead is said to have emerged in the buff, to be offered a martini by Robert Benchley, a long-time habitue. Sounds reasonable.\\n\\nDuring Prohibition, having an aperitif could be complicated. At Ocean House there was an extra hurdle. When Winston Churchill wanted a drink, Marion Davies took him on a tour of the facilities. Davies\\' lover and landlord, William Randolph Hearst, objected to her drinking. So she cached her gin in a toilet tank in one of the mansion\\'s fifty-five bathrooms and couldn\\'t remember which one.\\n\\nIt\\'s not Wallace\\'s fault that what was lost in Hollywood is flimsier than what was trashed in Manhattan. What can compare to the destruction of Pennsylvania Station, a heroic masterpiece that required a great deal of excavation? Hollywood structures are skimpier, like the electrical sign atop a hill known as Cahuenga Peak. It was intended to promote a real estate development called Hollywoodland. When the last four letters disintegrated, the sign survived as a civic attention-getter.\\n\\nSo Lost Hollywood focuses less on topography than on celebrity. One culture hero was Aimee Semple McPherson, a wildly popular evangelist, faith healer, and entrepreneur whose Angelus Temple is still one of the largest churches in America. Aimee\\'s organization included a radio station, several choirs, and an orchestra in which Anthony Quinn played the saxophone. But it couldn\\'t survive the scandal that ensued when the evangelist went AWOL for a month. She claimed to have been kidnapped by Mexican bandits. But when it turned out that she had been spending a naughty interlude with a married employee, the ridicule was overwhelming.\\n\\nAt the beginning of its silent film period, Hollywood was still a rural backwater. The vacant lots were abloom with orange poppies. \"On Vine Street they grew grapes,\" recollects the director Mack Sennett. \"That\\'s how it got its name.\" But by the 1920s, the town had developed a cosmopolitan ambience. Sightseeing buses were showing tourists the homes of internationally known film stars like Francis X. Bushman (\"America\\'s handsomest man\"), Harold Lloyd, Charlie Chaplin, and the megastar Rudolph Valentino. Valentino could often be seen in jodhpurs, walking his dogs (two mastiffs and a Doberman) along the narrow streets of a terraced development known as Whitley Heights.\\n\\nValentino may have gotten a bum rap as a shallow gigolo type. (\"Women adored him, but most men despised him.\") According to Wallace, he had a self-deprecating sense of humor. His mystique was even greater than Elvis\\'s. His funeral drew 100,000 mourners. What\\'s left of Whitley Heights is now listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It featured tiled roofs and wrought iron hardware in a Mediterranean style that became a Hollywood trademark.\\n\\nA lively chunk of Hollywood\\'s lost places consisted of its restaurants. They ranged from the whimsical -- like a bistro in the shape of a hat (the Brown Derby) -- to nightclubs where the stars went to be seen. Tourists visited the cabarets on the Sunset Strip, expecting to find a glitzy expanse like something out of Fred and Ginger\\'s Flying Down-to Rio. But, with one exception, the clubs were disappointingly intimate. The exception was the Coconut Grove, a vast nightspot in the Ambassador Hotel. It was born when the Grove\\'s host bought a thicket of fake palm trees, left over from the set of Valentino\\'s The Sheik. He installed them in a ballroom as big as an airplane hangar. It was an instant success, so much so that, by 1937, the club\\'s publicists were proud to announce that it had been the scene of 126 celebrity fights.\\n\\nHollywood\\'s lost landmarks have generated a vigorous rearguard action. The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission has gone to bat for the Cinerama Dome, a concrete igloo built in 1963. It\\'s the only surviving theater from the short-lived Cinerama mode, which employed a curved screen for a \"surround\" effect. Then there\\'s the L.A. Conservancy, a private preservationist group dedicated to \"preserving the city\\'s architectural heritage.\" This includes the Hanna-Barbera building, birthplace of the Flintstones and Yogi Bear. Others on the list of endangered landmarks are the Hollywood Bowl and the Lakeside Car Wash.\\n\\nPainted a revolting green, the Hanna-Barbera studio qualifies as \"Googie\" architecture, named after Googies, a vanished L.A. coffee shop with an in-your-face facade designed to capture drive-by attention. (Alan Hess, architecture critic of the San Jose Mercury News, anatomized this roadside wrinkle in his 1986 book Googie.)\\n\\nThe Conservancy has blocked the remodeling of the Angelus Temple, which would have obliterated a spectacular 40-foot mural over the proscenium. It has shored up the audience-friendly but acoustically archaic amphitheatre, the Hollywood Bowl. And it saved the Brown Derby from demolition. The brown bowler is now entombed in a shopping center.\\n\\nAs for the Lakeside Car Wash, according to a tourist guide: \"It\\'s the best one in Southern California, a study in lava rock and wood.\"\\n\\nWallace\\'s fetching Hollywood eulogy emits vibrations that tell you all is not lost. It\\'s certainly a pity that the landmark police were not mobilized in time to save the likes of Ocean House. But going to bat for a car wash does deliver a message to the demolition community. Namely: that it makes good sense to preserve a structure \"merely as a monument.\" No matter how tacky it may be.\\n\\nMartin Levin is a writer in New York.',\n",

       " ('\\n\\n\\n\\nPat Robertson did a remarkable interview with Li Zhaoxing, China\\'s ambassador to the United States, on the November 10 700 Club, Robertson\\'s long-running Christian Broadcasting Network show. Not surprisingly for a Pentecostal evangelist whose CBN WorldReach is the self-proclaimed \"first Christian charity to ever be licensed in the People\\'s Republic of China,\" Robertson spent much of the interview on religious freedom. But he went astonishingly easy on his interlocutor. Li Zhaoxing, remember, represents a government that still jails Christians who don\\'t bend to its will -- a government that even now is engaged in a Maoist crackdown on the Falun Gong movement, spiritualists who meditate and practice faith-healing. Because Falun Gong spooked the Beijing government earlier this year with a peaceful gathering in the Chinese capital that caught the authorities by surprise, the movement has been banned and its members are being jailed by the dozen. This, it turns out, is fine by Robertson. Some excerpts:\\n\\nROBERTSON: When I was in China, I was assured that there was religious freedom. I went to the various churches and I was quite pleased at the level of freedom in China. But what is happening recently that you\\'d like to discuss?\\n\\nLI: Well, the Chinese Constitution provides for the right of the citizens\\' freedom of religion. Indeed, at the moment we have maybe the biggest religious community among all countries in the world. We have more than 100 million people believing in various religions such as Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, and so forth.\\n\\nROBERTSON: There\\'s a sect that has come up, I understand, that the government has felt could not be allowed to continue. Could you tell us about that?\\n\\nLI: There is a sect, or indeed there is a cult, in China, by the name Falun Gong. Founded in the year of 1992. It is pretty new. It is very damaging and harmful. This cult was led by a gentleman called Li Hongzhi. He was quite a character. And a -- he deliberately changed his birthday from July the 7th to May the 31st.\\n\\nROBERTSON: Why did he do that?\\n\\nLI: Well, because he wanted to show off to both that he was the reincarnation of the founder, because that founder was born on the day of May 31st many years ago.\\n\\nROBERTSON: This leader deliberately changed his birthday to say I am the reincarnation? He was lying to the people.\\n\\nLI: Of course he was lying. Besides that, he said he\\'s -- he\\'s more elevated than China\\'s founder of Taoism and he\\'s more elevated by far greater even than Jesus Christ. So we can see that this is a man who is good at cheating people . . .\\n\\nROBERTSON: The National People\\'s Congress, I understand, passed a law prohibiting cults. Is this going to ever be applied to Christianity or Buddhism or some other religion?\\n\\nLI: Not at all. Because the government of China has only outlawed the cult Falun Gong. This has got nothing to do with any religion because the Falun Gong is not a religion. It is nothing but a cult.\\n\\nROBERTSON: All right.\\n\\nThe main question raised by this performance is whether, when Robertson collaborates with Beijing\\'s propaganda, he is simply complying with the terms of his charity\\'s license, or does he just not know better?',\n",

       " (\"\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Clinton's legal defense fund last week announced results for its most recent six months of hat-passing -- a period that began last August when the House received Ken Starr's impeachment referral and ended with the president's acquittal. All that publicity was a boon to the cause: $ 2.3 million rolled in from donors eager to help pay down the Clintons' debts to David Kendall, Bob Bennett, et al.\\n\\nThe celebrity contingent was not as large as one might have anticipated from the level of anti-Starr vituperation one read last year in Daily Variety. Still, for the record: Singers Tony Bennett and Don Henley each pitched in $ 10,000, the maximum allowed.

       " ('\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE WHITE HOUSE -- supremely confident until two weeks ago that the House of Representatives would not impeach the president -- is suddenly on the defensive. Lawyers for President Clinton, reversed themselves last week and decided to appear at the House Judiciary Committee hearing scheduled for December 8. This after White House officials had derided the entire impeachment inquiry as illegitimate. In another astonishing flip-flop, Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart and House democratic leader Richard Gephardt called last week for newt Gingrich to become more involved in the impeachment process. For weeks, Gephardt and Clinton aides had loudly complained that Gingrich\\'s involvement was excessive.\\n\\nThere is a simple explanation for these shifts: Administration officials are now terrified the president might actually be impeached. Last month\\'s election returns were supposed to have laid the issue to rest; there were though to be enough Republican defectors to defeat impeachment. Lately, though, the number of House Republicans breaking ranks has apparently been shrinking, and with at least three House Democrats saying they\\'ll vote to impeach, the once-prevailing wisdom is in doubt. According to a Clinton aide, this change persuaded White House officials to adopt new tactics -- including the lawyers\\' appearance before the committee.\\n\\nThe goal of their testimony is simple: to win over the few House members -- Democrats and Republicans -- who are wavering between censure and impeachment. According to the Clinton aide, the testimony is likely to be a point-by-point response to the allegations facing the president. Expect the lawyers to be more forthright than they were in answering the 81 questions from Henry Hyde, the Judiciary chairman, and to tone down their criticism of independent counsel Kenneth Starr.\\n\\nFor Republicans, another indication the impeachment pendulum had swung in their direction was the White House\\'s insistence last week that it be given access to reams of documents related to Starr\\'s impeachment referral, Kathleen Willey, and campaign-finance abuses. Hyde immediately questioned this eleventh-hour request, saying in a statement, \"I hope this last request by the White House is not intended to delay the committee\\'s proceedings.\" But all of a sudden, delay makes sense for the White House. After complaining for weeks that the impeachment inquiry was proceeding too slowly, administration officials would be happy to drag it out just enough to postpone an impeachment vote until January, when the Republicans\\' House majority will be smaller by five. But don\\'t expect this strategy to succeed: Any move to delay an impeachment vote will meet massive protest from House Republicans. Even speaker designate Bob Livingston, who\\'s been loath to express an opinion on the impeachment inquiry, admitted last week that he hopes the committee will finish its work this year.\\n\\nThe most desperate plea of all last week was the request from Gephardt and the White House for Gingrich to effectively take over the impeachment inquiry. \"I believe it is incumbent on you,\" said Gephardt, addressing the speaker, \"to provide the leadership necessary to move this process forward.\" The call fell on deaf ears. N The same day, the committee Republicans voted to subpoena materials related to the investigation of Clinton fund-raising abuses.\\n\\nThe first problem was that Republicans saw the request as ludicrous, coming as it did after shrieks from Gephardt and the White House a few months back that Gingrich was controlling the committee. Even has the request been less blatantly political, however, it wouldn\\'t have flown. Gingrich has checked out of Washington. He\\'s spending his time in Georgia and Florida, and his staff says he has handed the impeachment issue over to Livingston. Livingston, meanwhile, declines to interfere with the work of the Judiciary Committee: \"Until they complete their business or make a report to Congress, I can\\'t weigh in one way or another, and I won\\'t,\" he told the Wall Street Fournal.\\n\\nThe sudden show of vulnerability from the White House makes it all the less likely Livingston will give the Democrats the thing they want: a vote on censure this year. The White House figures a censure vote would take the pressure off some Hose members -- mostly Republicans -- to vote for impeachment. But senior House GOP sources say they\\'d be surprised if a censure vote occurred this year.\\n\\nInstead, here\\'s what is likely to happen: When the impeachment resolution is introduced in the Judiciary Committee, a committee Democrat will move that a censure resolution also be considered. Hyde will then do one of two things: rule the censure resolution out of order, at which point it will be dead, or allow a vote on the resolution, at which point it was easily be voted down by committee Republicans.\\n\\nBut the Democrats won\\'t stop there. With the support of a few Republicans, they will then try to introduce a censure resolution on the House floor. This too will fail. According to the House\\'s parliamentary procedures, a special resolution, such as one proposing to censure the president, can only be considered if it has the blessing of the Rules Committee. This means the resolution would, in effect, need the support of Livingston, as Rules traditionally follows the speaker. But no one expects Livingston, in his first act as speaker, to push the committee to allow a censure vote. Indeed, he would pay a price if he did. When Tom Delay, the House whip, spoke with an ideologically diverse group of over 40 House Republicans last week, not one of them favored allowing a censure vote.\\n\\nThe climate, in other words, is bad and getting worse for Clinton. Through all the wrangling last week, Republican aides to the Judiciary Committee, led by Thomas Mooney, the general counsel, and Jon Dudas, the staff director, quietly toiled in their Rayburn building offices, drafting the articles of impeachment the committee will consider at the end of the week. The White House and committee Democrats can scream and yell about one procedural matter of another, but they reality is that the impeachment train is chugging right along. And as one Clinton aide grimly admits, \"We don\\'t have any leverage to affect this.\"\\n\\nMatthew Rees is a staff writer at THE WEEKLY STANDARD.',\n",

       " ('\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo of America\\'s leading newspapers ran important stories on China last week. The Wall Street Journal\\'s Helene Cooper and Ian Johnson, in a front-page piece, laid out in minute detail the fact that many of the American corporations most eager for access to China\\'s market actually have little interest in exporting goods from the U.S. to China. Their real plan is to invest in China, and to produce goods for the Chinese market within China, employing Chinese workers. This was exactly the argument labor opponents of permanent normal trade relations for China had been making.\\n\\nA big story, no? And one especially relevant to last Wednesday\\'s vote passing PNTR. For as Cooper and Johnson noted, business lobbyists had deliberately \"played down\" that vote\\'s \"likely impact on investment\" because they were \"leery of sounding supportive of labor-union arguments that the deal would prompt companies to move U.S. production to China.\" So when did the Journal run this article exposing the falsity of this particular pro-PNTR argument? The day after the vote.\\n\\nThe Washington Post also broke big news on China last week. On the front page, under a banner headline, the Post ran Thomas E. Ricks\\'s 3,345 word story outlining how the Pentagon has shifted the focus of its concerns to Asia, and specifically, to China. Wargames, force planning, and strategic doctrine, according to Ricks, are all shifting in response to the growing perception among American strategists that a rising China poses the most formidable challenge to the United States in the years ahead.\\n\\nGiven the Clinton administration\\'s insistence on the national security benefits that will accrue from passage of PNTR, this news, too, might have seemed relevant to congressional deliberations last week. And when did the Post run its story on the rising threat of China? Two days after the vote.\\n\\nForgive us for wondering if this is a coincidence. Both stories were long and painstakingly researched: Clearly, both had been in the works for weeks. Are we to suppose the Journal couldn\\'t complete final editing on its story until one day after the PNTR vote? Was it coincidence that the Post couldn\\'t get the Ricks story out until two days after the vote? We hear a lot about corporate influence on the editorial decisions of news organizations. This looks like a choice morsel for a media watchdog.',\n",

       " ('\\n\\n\\n\\nWHEN AL GORE sought the Democratic nomination for president in 1988, three leading members of his Texas steering committee were Ken Armbrister, Hugo Berlanga, and Mark Stiles. All Democratic state legislators, they helped spread Gore\\'s name across Texas, and served as surrogate speakers for him at local candidate forums. Now that Gore is finally the Democratic nominee, however, they\\'re enthusiastically backing his opponent, George W. Bush.\\n\\nCall them Bush Democrats -- and they\\'re not alone. A recent national Gallup poll found that 14 percent of Democratic voters say they\\'ll be voting for Bush (Gore, by contrast, got just 3 percent of Republicans). This has Bush aides giddy. They\\'re now in the midst of a quiet effort to recruit more high-profile Democrats and independents to publicly back the Republican nominee this fall.\\n\\nIn Texas, Carlos Ramirez, the mayor of El Paso, is campaigning for Bush, and so is Rob Junell, who chairs the state\\'s House appropriations committee. Bush also has the support of Ralph Hall, a Democratic congressman from Texas. In Florida, Bush has enlisted a number of top Democrats: Wayne Mixson, a former lieutenant governor; Dick Greco, the mayor of Tampa; Bob Crawford, the state agriculture commissioner; Jim Naugle, the mayor of Fort Lauderdale; and Steve Uhlfelder, a top aide to Bob Graham when Graham was governor. From California, Bush has signed up Matthew Martinez, a Democratic congressman for the past 18 years. Defeated in his March primary, he was so bitter at how his party treated him he became a Republican late last month.\\n\\nBush has also won over some top Democratic party figures. Mark McKinnon and Matthew Dowd have worked for revered Texas politicians like Lloyd Bentsen and the late Bob Bullock, but now they\\'re handling media and polling for Bush. Sandy Kress, a former chairman of the Dallas County Democrats and an early organizer of the Democratic Leadership Council, is one of Bush\\'s education advisers. And Brian Lunde, a former executive director of the DNC who managed Paul Simon\\'s 1988 presidential campaign, will be organizing Bush\\'s Democratic and independent supporters. \"Bush has the perfect combination of good character and great competence,\" says Lunde.\\n\\nThe outreach to Democrats and independents is one piece of Bush\\'s effort to show that as president he would put policy before party. According to his Democratic supporters in the legislature, this is precisely the approach he\\'s taken in Texas. How else, they ask, could Bush have been endorsed for reelection in 1998 by Bullock, the Democratic lieutenant governor and godfather of one of the children of Bush\\'s Democratic opponent, Garry Mauro? (Bush touted this relationship at the Republican convention, where Bullock\\'s widow, Jan, was given a high-profile speaking role.)\\n\\nArmbrister, who campaigned for Ann Richards in 1994, recalls that shortly after Bush defeated Richards that year he was invited to a one-on-one meeting in the governor\\'s mansion. During their 45-minute chat, Bush asked about Armbrister\\'s interests, while deferring to his years of experience, saying, \"I\\'ve been around this business but I\\'ve never really done it. I hope I can call on you.\"\\n\\nHaving been on the receiving end of similar pleas from Richards and other governors, Armbrister appreciated the gesture but made little of it -- until Bush personally called him two weeks later, seeking his input on a contentious natural resources bill. \"That set the tone,\" says Armbrister, who lauds Bush as someone who\\'s continued to be \"very inclusive\" and more interested in the policy part of his job than the politics. \"He\\'s the best governor of the four I\\'ve worked with during my 17 years in the legislature.\" (Bush\\'s outreach is a striking contrast to Gore\\'s. Armbrister never heard from Gore after the 1988 campaign, and hasn\\'t forgotten that his work went completely unacknowledged.)\\n\\nBush\\'s success in cherry-picking Democrats and organizing them to speak out on his behalf is a small but potent indication of Gore\\'s failure to lock down Democrats, much less win over Republicans. If Gore reverts to type and tries to revive his fortunes by attacking Bush, the Bush Democrats will be more than happy to respond.\\n\\nAs Gore has zinged Bush for Texas\\'s supposedly Third World living conditions, Hugo Berlanga has delivered a pointed response: \"I\\'m not going to allow Vice President Gore to bash Texas, because if he\\'s going to, then he might as well bash the Democrats who have controlled Texas for the last 100 years.\"\\n\\nSimilarly, Gore tried last month to portray Bush as fiscally irresponsible by pointing to a supposed $ 610 million shortfall in the Texas budget. \"Dead wrong,\" replied Junell. But he didn\\'t stop there. He was angry enough about Gore\\'s charge that he responded in a conference call with national political reporters and then held a media briefing. Gore, said Junell, had \"manipulated\" the budget figures \"for political advantage,\" while Bush was doing \"a great job and we\\'re blessed to have him in Texas.\"\\n\\nMore generally, the Bush Democrats can share stories of Bush\\'s character. Kress, for example, recounts how Bush wrote a letter endorsing him in a school board race even though he was well known as a Democrat. Or how Bush, in 1993, invited him over to discuss education reform, questioned him for more than an hour, took copious notes, and then asked for the names of a dozen people also knowledgeable about education in Texas (and interviewed them too).\\n\\nIt\\'s a measure of Bush\\'s acceptability that not only are Democrats breaking ranks to support him, they\\'re feeling little heat for doing so. Armbrister says he\\'s received only a couple of angry calls and letters. Similarly, Sandy Kress, who\\'s a partner in the powerhouse Democratic law firm of Akin Gump, has yet to hear any grumbling from his colleagues.\\n\\nThe exception is Carlos Ramirez, the El Paso mayor, who has campaigned with Bush in California and New Hampshire and introduced him at an Austin rally after he\\'d clinched the nomination. For these heretical acts, the county Democratic organization approved a resolution excommunicating Ramirez from the party. Not that he cared much. The resolution has no practical meaning, and Ramirez still spoke at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.\\n\\nDowd, who directs the campaign\\'s polling and media planning operations, has a particularly interesting story of how he came to Bush. A former aide to Lloyd Bentsen, Dowd managed the senator\\'s joint bid in 1988 for the vice presidency and the Senate. In 1989, he opened a consulting business, Public Strategies, and stayed active in politics by managing two successful lieutenant governor campaigns for Bullock. Through Bullock, who died of cancer last year, he came to know Bush, and was impressed with his almost nonpartisan approach to governing and his refusal, as Dowd puts it, to \"pigeonhole\" people on the basis of party affiliation.\\n\\nDowd had no intention of joining Bush\\'s presidential campaign -- he was planning a one-year sabbatical from work -- but his Public Strategies colleague McKinnon persuaded him to come aboard. He was deeply involved in devising an advertising strategy for the Republican primaries, but his current mandate is one for which he\\'s especially qualified: boosting Bush\\'s appeal among independents, swing voters, and . . . Democrats.\\n\\nMatthew Rees is a staff writer at THE WEEKLY STANDARD.',\n",

       " ('\\n\\n\\n\\nWITH CONSIDERABLE fanfare, the Clinton administration last week struck an agreement with China that should clear the way for its membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO). On paper, the deal has many positive features. But U.S.-China trade relations are a saga of great press releases and poor results. A verdict on the present agreement must be withheld until it has been tested in practice. As Congress considers the package next year, members will want to make sure that as much energy goes into its enforcement as went into its negotiation.\\n\\nIn principle, China has agreed to lower its tariffs from an average of over 22 percent to an average of about 17 percent. Some tariffs will remain high, including the 25 percent tariff on automobiles. Indeed, Chinese tariffs overall will remain much higher than those of most major trading countries, such as the United States, which have tariffs in the low single digits.\\n\\nChina has also agreed to liberalize some of its service sectors, such as banking and telecommunications. Nevertheless, Western firms will have far less than free access to these markets. In the telecommunications sector, they will be allowed only minority shares in ventures. This represents backsliding from the offer of majority ownership made in April.\\n\\nAmerica\\'s farmers -- promised new access to the Chinese marketplace -- may well experience the biggest short-term gains. Most of the barriers to be phased down in this sector are easily verifiable measures, like tariffs, which makes it difficult to cheat. U.S. exports of wheat, feed grains, and other farm products to China are likely to expand.\\n\\nFor the most part, the Clinton administration was able to convince China to agree to the package Washington had offered, then withdrawn in April. The new agreement, however, is merely the beginning of a long process aimed at integrating China into the world economy. Only after other countries, including the European Union, complete their bilateral talks with China will a final multilateral accession protocol be inked. The agreement between the United States and China was the major hurdle, however, and China\\'s WTO membership now seems likely this year.\\n\\nWhether China\\'s accession is ultimately in the best interest of the United States will depend on whether China can be made to live by the rules of the WTO. If it can, China will become a much more reliable trade and investment partner. Further, the WTO\\'s mandates to reduce subsidies and limit government interference in the economy, if they are followed, could boost reformers\\' efforts to make China a market economy. Unfortunately, those are very big ifs.\\n\\nEvery trade agreement the United States has struck with China has run into serious enforcement problems. China\\'s compliance with the 1992 agreement on intellectual property was so poor that the United States has threatened trade sanctions on several occasions. The administration officially acknowledges more than half a dozen Chinese violations of the 1992 bilateral memorandum of understanding on market access -- an agreement analogous in substance and scope to a WTO accession agreement.\\n\\nThe main problem appears to be that China lacks the legal infrastructure to force its diverse ministries, provincial authorities, and state-owned enterprises to abide by commitments. Within China there is a range of opinions on the wisdom and appropriate pace of economic reform. The group led by Zhu Rongji is interested in Western-style economic reform, but it is only one faction in a contentious political landscape.\\n\\nWithout the rule of law, there is no counterweight to the traditional incentives to cheat on trade agreements and so minimize the economic and political pain of losing noncompetitive industries. Nor is there any means of enforcing orderly resolution of disputes. Compliance problems become barriers to progress sufficient to raise questions about the wisdom of concluding trade agreements in the first place. In short, this is more than a minor irritation.\\n\\nMany point to the highly unusual public criticism of Zhu\\'s trade concessions inside China as evidence that the new agreement is a good deal for the United States. But it also suggests just how difficult obtaining compliance is likely to be. Zhu apparently did not have wide domestic support for the reforms he offered. Instead of quietly folding their hand, the critics are likely to employ the same bureaucratic tactics used to frustrate past agreements. The welling up of opposition may be evidence that China\\'s concessions will ultimately prove significant, but it may also portend their going unfulfilled.\\n\\nSome naively argue that the WTO will force the Chinese to deliver. This view both exaggerates the capabilities of the WTO and misapprehends the nature of the Chinese system. Keep in mind, the WTO has proven largely ineffective at convincing even Europe, which maintains a transparent and largely open trading regime, to amend its policies on banana and meat imports.\\n\\nChina is a far tougher case. Its economy not only is not based on the rule of law, it also is almost entirely opaque. The WTO relies on transparency in order to evaluate policies and reach enforcement decisions. It may well prove impossible even to establish the existence of protectionist Chinese trade policies before a WTO panel, much less secure rulings against them.\\n\\nAnd there is another cause for skepticism: Once China is a member of the WTO, the United States would be expected to forgo unilateral trade sanctions, the only tool that has so far demonstrated the ability to curb Chinese mercantilism. It may be possible to fashion, say, a WTO-based multilateral oversight committee to monitor Chinese implementation without waiting for disputes to arise. And innovative enforcement provisions from past accession arrangements with other countries might allow U.S. authorities to take certain actions if China is not fulfilling its promises.\\n\\nThis may also be an area where a special role could be created for Congress, which historically has been more inclined to enforce trade agreements than the executive branch. Administrations of both parties have seemed more interested in negotiating new agreements than enforcing old ones. Congress has also been willing to confront China, while the executive branch seems forever concerned with poorly defined geopolitical objectives and uninterested in the particulars of trade. Perhaps a formal benchmarking process could be created by which Congress would review Chinese compliance and launch any necessary enforcement actions under U.S. trade law. This could be accomplished without violating the WTO.\\n\\nIt is important to emphasize, again: All of the potential commercial and long-term economic benefits of China\\'s WTO accession depend on the agreement\\'s being enforced. A strong and consistent enforcement process could provide an important boost to reformers in China as well as a boon to U.S. exporters. A meaningful enforcement regime would make the difference between another \"press release agreement\" and a significant accord.\\n\\nThe merits of any given deal are easily lost sight of amid the customary overselling of trade agreements. Both proponents and opponents of NAFTA grossly exaggerated its impact, and the China package is getting similar treatment. The reality is that China buys a mere 2 percent of U.S. exports -- less than Taiwan, Belgium, or Holland. If all goes well, that figure will expand modestly, to perhaps as much as 2.5 percent. At the same time, increased Chinese access to the U.S. textile market will probably expand the U.S. trade deficit with China. There still may be good reason to go forward with the WTO package, but we should do so with realistic expectations.\\n\\nBeyond that, there looms the issue of China\\'s currency. In order to boost its trade account and combat deflation, Beijing seems to be on the verge of a sharp devaluation. In the short term, devaluation would completely eclipse the benefits to American exporters from a WTO pact. If China joins the WTO but devalues its currency in 2000, the result will likely be increased imports from China, decreased exports to China, and a widening trade deficit.\\n\\nOne unequivocally positive possibility that could be opened by this agreement, meanwhile, is Taiwanese membership in the WTO. China has been the major barrier to Taiwan\\'s accession, but administration officials claim that China will now refrain from objecting. This could be as important for U.S. commercial and foreign policy interests as China\\'s membership, given that Taiwan already imports $ 3 billion more annually from the United States than China. The case for China\\'s WTO accession is mixed, but Taiwan plainly deserves membership. It is now up to the Clinton administration and the Congress to make sure that the \"other China\" is not forgotten in the WTO endgame.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, it is difficult to know what effect China\\'s WTO membership would have. It is possible that U.S. and Chinese leaders would lose interest in the process, and the agreement would end up having very little impact. Equally, the WTO might be unable to police China\\'s closed economy. Under the worst case, China would prove too much for the WTO, and the organization would lose its fragile credibility as a result of this failure.\\n\\nPerhaps the WTO, the U.S. administration, and the U.S. Congress can work together to create effective enforcement mechanisms that would make China\\'s WTO accession a positive event -- at best, an event that would help bring the rule of law to China and integrate the world\\'s most populous country into the global economy. But this will require a more hard-headed view of China than the Clinton administration has shown.\\n\\nGreg Mastel is director of the Global Economic Policy Project at the New America Foundation.',\n",

Our guide says they are from a small pack of only four adult animals. The alpha female is back at a temporary den with some puppies and these three, the alpha male, another male and one female are out hunting.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfrican Wild Dogs along with Cheetahs are the most endangered predators in Africa. There are an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 left in the wild. A few decades ago there were about a half a million wild dogs with packs of over 100 animals being common. Now due to habitat loss, hunting and poisoning by humans, and diseases such as canine distemper and rabies contracted from domestic dogs the population continues to decrease.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe follow the trio as they survey the area.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn profile they look a little like a German Shepard, when you can\\'t see they have big round Mickey Mouse ears. They are actually the only species in their genus Lycaon. They are Lycaon pictus, the painted wolf.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe dogs head off into the bush and we attempt to follow in the Land Rovers. Soon we see a herd of impala and the dogs go into slink mode and then take off in a sprint. We try to follow but the brush is too dense to keep up but in a few minutes we get a call on the radio. They have made a kill. The two males chased one of the impala into the river channel and caught up to on the other side in some high grass. We arrive in time to see them attacking the still alive impala but our view, probably fortunatly, is blocked by the grass.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe two males with the kill.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe female has been left behind on our side of the river and she doesn\\'t know where they are.

The implications made for the latter put full blame for the declared crimes on the Assad/Russia combination. Her three guests today were: Louise Arbour, former Canadian Supreme Court Justice; Stephane Dion, current Liberal foreign affairs minister; and Stephen O\\'Brien, UN Undersecretary General for Humanitarian Affairs. All three avidly reflected and supported the \"war crimes\" thesis of Ms. Barton.\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nFirst, the \"Fall of Aleppo\"\\n\\nFrom the many sources I have read, from the many history books and contemporary events books I have read, the very title \"Fall of Aleppo\" is a lie. Aleppo - at least a good part of it, \"fell\" to the al-Qaeda/al-Nusra related so called rebels about four years ago. These \\'rebels\\' were aided and abetted by the U.S. CIA, indirectly through our great democratic allies in Saudi Arabia, and more discreetly, at first at least, by our Turkish NATO ally. Yes there were protests, but the violence came from outside (hmmm, perhaps the call for war crimes investigations should extend back in time...more later).\\n\\nWhat is actually happening in Aleppo is a victory of government forces, aided by its allies, in retaking the part of Aleppo that was held under the severe hand of the Islamic fundamentalist groups. The way the CBC and other western MSM present the story is as if the \"moderate\" terrorists - which the U.S. failed to identify - were the ones besieged in Aleppo. Certainly the civilians trapped in this \"cauldron\" (the non-western term used for the surrounding and defeat of the rebel/terrorist groups) have suffered, as they do in all wars. They will continue to suffer until the Assad government - okay call it a regime, which it is just as much as Trudeau\\'s government is a regime considering it governs with only 40 per cent of the populations approval (at last count) - until the government can restore some semblance of security to the city as a whole. The civilians were essentially hostages to the rebel/terrorist forces, not allowed to leave the area, killed if they tried, subject to enforced fundamentalist rules.\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nIn short, Aleppo has not fallen, Aleppo has recovered from its hostage taking by the terrorists. Aleppo has been liberated.\\n\\n- For sure, all wars are crimes, but how far back do you want to go?\\n\\nNext Page 1 | 2 | 3 | 4',\n",

       " ('\\n\\nClassic 1897 painting of Diplodocus\\n\\nA few weeks ago I happened to listen to a fascinating interview on NPR with Brian Switek, the blogger behind Laelaps, and author of Written in Stone: Evolution, the Fossil Record, and Our Place in Nature. Switek was discussing his newest book, My Beloved Brontosaurus: On the Road with Old Bones, New Science, and Our Favorite Dinosaurs. To be frank I was captivated by the discussion, and immediately purchased a copy of the book. The reason is simple: despite our current divergent interests Brian Switek began at the same place I did, with dinosaurs. Though after reading My Beloved Brontosaurus I can’t assert that my dinomania matched Switek’s, it was of the same quality. The difference is that while Switek remained true to dinosaurs, my own interests wandered into other domains. Today I am focused more upon evolutionary forces operating on the scale of thousands of years within a species, rather than geological scale transmogrifications. But every now and then I wonder about dinosaurs, and whatever happened to them over the past 20 years after my “dinosaurs years” faded into the distance.\\n\\nAnd that exactly where Switek takes me with My Beloved Brontosaurus . I read The Dinosaur Heresies in the early 1990s, but that book is now 25 years old. Yes, like everyone else I’ve seen glimmers of the controversies of the debates about dinosaur metabolism and plumage over the years,. And that is what Switek does, as he tours us through abstruse and esoteric journals in paleobiology to get the heart of the matter in terms of what scientists believe and know. For me the narrative was especially fascinating because I am approximately the same age as the author, and experienced many of the same cultural changes in our perceptions of dinosaurs. From lethargic large lizards to bright feathered monstrosities.\\n\\nThere are three primary threads in My Beloved Brontosaurus. First, a cultural history of our society’s perception of what dinosaurs looked like, how they lived, what they were in some fundamental fashion. Second, there is the cutting edge science as to what we now know of dinosaur anatomy, behavior, and systematics. Third, there is Switek’s personal biography as it relates to dinosaurs, and his reminiscences of the experience of being at various field sites.\\n\\nOur perception of dinosaurs and what we know about them today in a scientific manner are obviously related. Switek’s distillation of the latest peer reviewed literature would make far less sense if we didn’t have an understanding from where we came in terms of our perceptions and preconceptions. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries dinosaurs were “terrible lizards” literally in their depction. They were green or gray sprawling reptiles, torpid and cold-blood creatures which were destined for the dust-bin of history (ergo, “he is such a dinosaur!”). Today the view is totally different. Dinosaurs are not extinct, because birds seem to be a derived lineage of theropod dinosaurs (and the extinction of the non-avian lineage is but for the grace of meteor!). It is now the majority view that many, if not most, dinosaurs were both warm blooded, and, had feathers. Not only did they have feathers, but paleontologists have been able to reconstruct the pigmentation of some dinosaurs. Would you believe they had the plumage of magpies!\\n\\nIf you want to know if dinosaurs were social, what they sounded like, and why they may have risen to prominence in the late Triassic, My Beloved Brontosaurus has you covered. Switek’s scope of knowledge is awesome. In Jerry Coyne’s Why Evolution is True he is referred to as a graduate student in paleontology at Rutgers. The reality is that when those words were written Switek was an undergraduate. But it’s easy to see how one could just assume he had to be a graduate student. His peregrinations across the country in search of museums and dig sites reflects a personality which one ideally would find in a graduate student, but alas far too often one does not.\\n\\nOne point in this book that I do want to explore is the controversy over the extinction of the dinosaurs. The public perception is that the K-T boundary exists because of a massive meteor impact. But a few years ago I saw an interview with the paleontologist Peter Ward where he denied that this was established and accepted science, which took me aback. I was interested to see that in Switek’s telling this seems a minority position, and that most scholars still accept the K-T event’s paramount importance. This is reassuring, because too often historical scientists fixate on uniformitarianism to an almost irrational extent. The wiping away of massively charismatic genera after genera all across the world over the space of a < 1 million years suggests something genuinely catastrophic. Denying the likelihood of a major exogenous shock, as opposed to a more prosaic confluence of events, bespeak a paradigmatic narrowness. If there is anything My Beloved Brontosaurus did it was to prevent me from wasting my time reading the literature in this area.\\n\\nI’m hoping Switek keeps following up with these sorts of books. This is in the classic “news you can use” for nerds genre.',\n",

Good friends with Les Siegelman, he introduced Les\\'s brother, [former] Alabama Governor Don Siegelman to Richard Scrushy, a local Republican businessman. Because of this, White became inextricably intertwined with Siegelman, who was one of the biggest targets of the Rove-directed, heavily politicized Department of Justice [DOJ].\\n\\nScrushy and Siegelman were later indicted and convicted on charges stemming from that relationship. According to affidavits provided by Gary [and Judy, who was also in the room] White was asked to perjure himself before a Grand Jury in order to make the case against Siegelman and Scrushy. White refused and the very next day, the DOJ started delivering subpoenas to build a case against him. White is serving ten years and is currently in a facility in Montgomery, Alabama. [BOP is Bureau of Prisons.]\\n\\nThis is installment #34. [Links to entire series at end of article*.]\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nMy guest today is frequent OpEdNews contributor, Judy White.\\n\\nJB: Welcome back to OpEdNews, Judy. This is an anniversary of sorts for you, isn\\'t it? Please tell us about it.\\n\\nJW: Thank you, Joan. Gary\\'s imprisonment date was September 29th, not an anniversary to be celebrated, but a somber marking of a tragic date and the passing of another year stolen from us. Every minute of every day we live with the absolute knowledge of Gary\\'s innocence, the pain of loss that never ends, and now five years of the most outrageous abuses imaginable.\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nTo make matters even worse - as if that is possible - Gary is now missing. I haven\\'t heard from him since Tuesday, prison \"anniversary\" day, and he is not at the prison. Rumor has it that he has been hospitalized with some medical crisis.\\n\\nJB: How nerve-wracking! What do you mean?\\n\\nJW: Late Tuesday, Gary was summoned and ordered to report Wednesday morning at 5:30 to be taken for testing to determine if he has cancer. I know it\\'s been a while and all the dates and details get muddled so to remind you, the BOP wrote in Gary\\'s prison medical records well over three years ago that they believe he has cancer, then they promptly and persistently did nothing, exhibiting deliberate indifference and committing medical abuse of Gary. Three months ago, when we did the last installment, Gary had begun passing blood and blood clots in his urine, a clear medical emergency for which they refused to provide or obtain appropriate necessary medical attention. After our discussion was published, they then did.... something. In true BOP-fashion, it was bizarre.\\n\\nGary was taken to a urologist in Montgomery, accompanied by a thug prison guard. He was so hopeful and relieved, thinking he was finally going to receive the medical attention he has so desperately needed for all these years. But when Gary was called to see the doctor, the doctor was outspokenly irritated - with the prison guard. After looking at the BOP paperwork, he addressed the guard scoldingly, saying (paraphrasing): \"There is no authorization for testing, no authorization for a CT scan. I\\'ve told you before that I can\\'t assess without testing but you keep bringing them without authorization for testing. How am I supposed to do anything without testing or authorization?\" Clearly, the BOP is in the habit of sending prisoners to a doctor while tying the doctor\\'s hands, refusing to authorize medical tests necessary to assess, diagnose and treat medical problems.\\n\\nJB: That sounds insane.\\n\\nJW: Keep in mind, Joan, that very few prisoners are taken out of prison to see any doctor. Only the most critically needy ones are taken. Federal prisons have \"medical officers\" who are supposed to take care of prisoners\\' medical needs in prison. Only when prisoners become very sick or symptomatic of a critical illness or disease or experience a medical crisis or emergency are they taken from prison to see a \"real\" doctor and even then, it is a doctor chosen, contracted and controlled by the BOP. And paid by our tax dollars, money that is wasted by taking a patient-prisoner to a doctor while refusing to allow the doctor to perform the very tests necessary to diagnose a patient\\'s medical condition. Obviously, such doctors\\' findings would go a long way toward proving medical abuse and deliberate indifference by the BOP, IF they were allowed to perform tests. The doctor did do something helpful for Gary, though. He confirmed that the medication the BOP has been giving Gary does, in fact, skew PSA test results, making the result artificially low and hiding cancer, a fact included as a warning on the medication\\'s insert that has been directly denied by the prison medical employees. In fact, the doctor told Gary that with his medical history he should not be taking that medication at all.\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nWith nothing meaningful allowed to be done to address Gary\\'s medical emergency, the prison guard took Gary back to prison. Gary called me immediately and was very upset, his hopes for medical help dashed. When I contacted the regional office to complain, they snappishly told me Gary was, in fact, receiving proper medical care and that he had been taken to a doctor, as if being taken to a doctor does anything at all when they refused to allow the doctor to do anything. It\\'s like being told he isn\\'t hungry, he was just taken to a restaurant while disregarding that he was not allowed to order anything or eat. Totally outrageous and abusive.\\n\\nSome time later, Gary was taken out of prison again, not to see a doctor but to an imaging facility for tests, the results of which were withheld from Gary until I contacted the imaging facility directly seeking the report and learned the report had been sent to the prison doctor. They refuse to give Gary anything in writing - too dangerous as evidence of medical abuse and deliberate indifference - but after I let Gary know and contacted the prison and regional office, then Gary began to make efforts to get the results, Gary was summoned and told the prison \"doctor\\'s\" opinion that he did not have cancer. Unfortunately, as we learned, the tests ordered by the prison doctor to be performed by the imaging center do not and cannot assess bladder cancer, which would be a primary concern with blood in his urine. Standard medical protocol is to perform a bladder scope, which Gary pointed out and was told they would begin paperwork to get approval. Have I mentioned medical emergency? If Gary had been taken to the emergency room as he should have as soon as he began passing blood, all the correct tests would have been performed, he would have received a reliable diagnosis and any needed treatment would have been initiated.\\n\\n\\n\\nGary and fam, Fort Morgan, AL, 2001\\n\\n(Image by courtesy of Judy White) Permission Details DMCA\\n\\n\\n\\nNext Page 1 | 2 | 3 | 4',\n",

       " ('\\n\\nHominin increase in cranial capacity, courtesy of Luke Jostins\\n\\nA few years ago a statistical geneticist at Cambridge’s Sanger Institute, Luke Jostins, posted the chart above using data from fossils on cranial capacity of hominins (the human lineage). As you can see there was a gradual increase in cranial capacity until ~250,000 years before the present, and then a more rapid increase. I should also note that from what I know about the empirical data, mean human cranial capacity peaked around the Last Glacial Maximum. Our brains have been shrinking, even relative to our body sizes (we’re not as large as we were during the Ice Age). But that’s neither here nor there. In the comments Jostins observes:\\n\\nThe data above includes all known Homo skulls, but none of the results change if you exclude the 24 Neandertals. In fact, you see the same results if you exclude Sapiens but keep Neandertals; the trends are pan-Homo, and aren’t confined to a specific lineage….\\n\\nIn other words: the secular increase in cranial capacity for our lineage extends millions of years back into the past, and also shifts laterally to “side-branches” (with our specific terminal node, H. sapiens sapiens, as a reference). This is why I often contend as an aside thatBy humanity I do not mean H. sapiens sapiens, the descendants of a subset of African hominins who flourished ~100,000 years before the present, but intelligent and cultural hominins who would inevitably construct a technological civilization. The parallel trends across the different distinct branches of the hominin family tree which Luke Jostins observed indicated to me that our lineage was not special, but simply first. That is, if African hominins were exterminated by aliens ~100,000 years before the present, at some point something akin to H. sapiens sapiens in creativity and rapidity of cultural production would eventually arise (in all likelihood later, but possibly earlier!).\\n\\nThis does not mean that I think humanity was inevitable upon earth. For most of the history of this planet life was unicellular. I do not find it implausible that life on earth may have reached its “sell by” date due to astronomical events before the emergence of complex organisms (in fact, from what I have heard the end of life is going to occur ~1 billion years into the future due to the persistent increase in the energy output of Sol, not ~4 billion years in the future when Sol turns into a red giant). But, once complex organisms arose it does seem that further complexity was inevitable. This was Richard Dawkins’ case in The Ancestor’s Tale based simply on the descriptive record. But did the emergence of complex organisms necessarily entail the evolution of a technological species? I don’t think so. It took 500 million years for that to occur (it does not seem that coal resources formed hundreds of millions of years ago were tapped before humans). Given enough time obviously a technological species would evolve (e.g., extend the time of evaluation to 1 trillion years), but note that the earth has only ~5 billion years. Homo arrived on the scene in the last 20% of that interval.\\n\\nHere I am positing at a minimum two not excessively likely or inevitable events over a 5 billion year time span which would lead to a hyper-technological and cultural species:\\n\\n- The emergence of multicellular life\\n\\n- The emergence of a lineage with the propensities of Homo\\n\\nOne Homo evolved and expanded outside of Africa I suspect that something of the form of a technological civilization became inevitable n this planet. We see parallelism in our own short post-Pleistocene epoch. Multiple human societies shifted from hunter-gatherers to agriculturalists over the past 10,000 years. The experience of the New World civilizations in particular illustrates that human universal tendencies are real. Not only were “game changing” cultural forms such as agriculture and literacy invented independently during the Holocene, but they were not invented during earlier interglacials (at least in all likelihood).\\n\\n\\n\\nKhufu, Necho, Augustus and Napoleon\\n\\nWhy not? Well, consider the cultural torpidity of Paleolithic toolkits, which might persist for hundreds of thousands of years! I suspect some of this due to biology. But even over the Holocene we do perceive that cultural change has proceeded at a more rapid clip as time has progressed (i.e., at a minimum cultural change has been accelerating, and it may be that the rate of acceleration itself is increasing!). Consider that the civilization of ancient Egypt spanned at least 2,000 years. Though there are clear differences, the continuity between Old Kingdom Egypt and the last dynasties before the Assyrian and Persian conquests is very obvious to us, and would be obvious to ancient Egyptians. In contrast, 2,000 years separates us from Augustan Rome. The continuities here are clear as well (e.g., the Roman alphabet), but the cultural change is also clear (if you wish to argue that the early modern and modern period are sui generis, the 1,500 year interval from Augustan Rome to the Neo-Classical Renaissance would still be a stark contrast when compared against an ancient Egyptian reference*, despite the latter’s aping of the forms of the former).\\n\\nSo far I have focused on the vertical dimension of time. But there is also the lateral dimension, of cross-fertilization across the branches of the hominin family tree. The admixture of a Neanderthal element into non-Africans has started to become widely accepted recently, thanks to the confluence of archaeology and genomics in the field of ancient DNA. Even if one rejects the viability of Neanderthal admixture, the solution to the conundrum of these results must still entail stepping away from a simple model of recent exclusive origin of humans from a small African population. There are also hints of admixture with other archaic lineages on the Pacific fringe, and within Africa.\\n\\nUntil recently it was common to posit that modern humans, our own lineage, had some special genius which allowed it to sweep the field and extinguish our cousins. The qualitative result of Luke Jostins’ plot was known; that other hominin lineages also exhibited encephalization. In fact, it was a curious fact that Neanderthals on average had larger cranial capacities than anatomically modern humans. But the reality remained that we replaced them, ergo, we must have a special genius. Until the lack of distinction between Neanderthals and modern humans on loci implicated in the necessary (if not sufficient) competency of language that trait was a prime candidate for what made “us” special. But now I put “us” in quotation marks. The data do point to an overwhelming descent from an African or near-African population for non-Africans over the past 100,000 years. But the “archaic admixture” is not trivial. What was they are us, and we have become what they might have been.\\n\\nFor over two centuries there has been a debate in the West between monogenesis and polygenesis. The former is the position that humankind derives from one single pair or population (the former a straightforward recapitulation of the standard Abrahamic model). The latter is the position that different races of humans derive from different proto-humans, or, for the Christian polygenists that only Europeans descent from Adam and Eve (the other races being “non-Adamic”). Echoes of this conflict persist down to the present era. Many of the earlier partisans of “Out of Africa” have claimed that the proponents of multiregionalism were latter-day polygenists (not without total justification in some cases).\\n\\nBut the conflict between monogenism and polygenism is not the appropriate frame for what is being unveiled by reality before our eyes. What we see in the creation of modern humanity is a monogenic base inflected with the flavors of polygenism. Modern humans descend, by and large, from an expansion of an African population over the past 200,000 years. But on the margins there are other strands and filaments of ancestry which tie disparate populations back to lineages which branched off far earlier from the main trunk. At a minimum hundreds of thousands, and perhaps an order of 1 million years, before our own age. Today genomics avails of us the statistical power to extract out these discordant signals from the fluid “Out of Africa” narrative, but I would not be surprised if in the near future we stumble upon more and more “long branches” of less noteworthy quantity. Admixture is likely to be an old and persistent story in the hominin lineage, with only the most recent substantial bouts of separation and hybridization being of notice and curiosity at this moment in time.\\n\\nWhat does all this mean? And why have I juxtaposed deep time natural history across the tree of life with inferences of relatively recent paleoanthropology? Let’s start with two propositions:\\n\\n- Technological civilization, an outward manifestation of radically complex sentience, is not inevitable, though it is probable given certain preconditions (I believe that the existence of Homo increased its probability to ~1.0 over a reasonable time period)\\n\\n- Radically complex sentience is not the monopoly of a particular exclusive lineage which accrues its genius from a particular specific forebear\\n\\nJohn Farrell has pointed out the possible issues that the Roman Catholic church may have with the new model of human origins. But the Catholic church is only but a reflection of more general human strain of thought. Descent-groups, whether real or fictive, loom large in the human imagination. The evolutionary rationale for this is not too hard to explain, but we co-opt the importance of kinship in many different domains. Like evolution, human cultural forms simply take what is already present, and retrofit and modify elements to taste.\\n\\nSo why are humans special? And why do humans have inalienable rights? Many of us may not agree with the proposition that we are the descendants of Adam and Eve, and therefore we were granted the divine grace of eternal souls. But a hint of this logic can be found in the assumptions of many thinkers who do not agree with the propositions of the Roman Catholic church. Recently I listened to Sherry Turkle arguing against a reliance on “robot companions” which are able to exhibit the verisimilitude of human emotions for those who may be lacking in companionship (e.g., the aged and infirm). Though Turkles’ arguments were not without foundation, some of her arguments were of the form that “they are not us, they are not real, we are real. And that matters.” This is certainly true now, but will it always be? Who is this “they” and this “we”? And what does “real” mean? Are emotions a mysterious human quality, which will remain outside of the grasp of those who do not descend from Adam, literal or metaphorical?\\n\\nIf there arises a point where non-human sentience is a reality, do they have the same rights as we? Though the difference is radical in terms of quantity to some extent I think we know the answer: they are human by the way they are, not by the way their ancestors were. The “taint” of admixture with diverse lineages across the present human tree of life has not resulted in an updating of our understanding of human rights. That is because the idea that we are all the children of Adam, or the descendants of mitochondrial Eve, is a post facto justification for our understanding of what the rights of humanity are, adn what humanity is. And what it is is a particular ecological niche, a way of being, not being who descend down in a line of biological relationship from a particular person or persons.\\n\\n* The cultural fundamentals of Old Kingdom Egypt arguably persisted in a living fossil form in the temple at Philae down to the 6th century A.D.!

       " ('\\n\\nNEW YORK – As former Sectary of State Hillary Clinton prepares to testify before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, new documentary evidence of a secret State Department gun-running operation is adding fuel to the controversy over the Department of Justice prosecution of arms dealer Marc Turi.\\n\\nA member of the independent Citizens Commission on Benghazi claims the publication Tuesday of new evidence that the State Department under Hillary Clinton’s leadership approved a California company to deliver arms to Libya with the goal of ousting Moammar Gadhafi exposes the hypocrisy of prosecuting Turi.\\n\\nTuri believed he also had State Department approval for arranging a similar clandestine arms shipment to Libya in 2011.\\n\\nFind out what really happened: Aaron Klein’s “The REAL Benghazi Story” exposes the ongoing cover-up\\n\\n“At long last, some of the details about Secretary Clinton’s Department of State gun-running operation to the al-Qaida-and-Muslim-Brotherhood-dominated Libyan rebels are beginning to emerge,” said Clare Lopez, a member of the Citizens’ Commission who served as a career operations officer with the CIA and is currently vice president for research at the Washington-based Center for Security Policy.\\n\\n“It’s long been known that under President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton, the U.S. switched sides in the global war on terror, but the White House successfully concealed much about its agenda to replace secular North African leaders with Muslim Brotherhood regimes – until now,” she said.\\n\\nThe Washington Times reported Tuesday that two documents picked up in Benghazi after the Sept. 11, 2012, attack that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens show diplomats at the compound were tracking several clandestine State Department-authorized shipments of weapons.\\n\\nOne of those shipments was to be delivered to the Transitional National Council, the Libyan movement seeking to oust Gadhafi.\\n\\nThe Washington Times reported an end-use certificate from the State Department’s office of trade defense controls proved Dolarian Capital Inc. of Fresno, California, had been licensed to ship to Libya a weapons cache that included rocket launchers, grenade launchers, 7,000 machine guns and 8 million rounds of ammunition.\\n\\nThe newspaper further reported that Dolarian Capital had received State Department approval in 2011 to ship weapons to Libya via Kuwait, only to have the State Department inexplicably revoke the license prior to the shipment.\\n\\nLopez said the State Department’s approval of the shipment “attests to the reality of the United States government’s clandestine gun-running operation, sometimes referred to as ‘Zero Footprint.’”\\n\\n“That Marc Turi, who also followed legal protocol in submitting requests to provide arms to the Libyan rebels, should be subject to prosecution by the Department of Justice over an alleged paperwork charge – even though in the end he never shipped any weapons to Libya at all – is a travesty, when the actual providers, the arms dealers who actually did supply weapons to the Libyan al-Qaida militias, with U.S. and NATO approval, have scarcely even been named, much less charged with any crime,” Lopez said.\\n\\n“It is long past time that Secretary Clinton and the entire Obama administration be held accountable to the American people – and the families of those who gave their lives in Benghazi – for these policies,” Lopez concluded.\\n\\nAs WND previously reported, on Feb. 11, 2014, the Department of Justice indicted Turi for allegedly making false statements in filing to obtain a license to supply weapons to Libya.\\n\\nWND has further reported that Turi’s defense attorney, Jean-Jacques Cabou of the law firm Perkins Coie LLP in Arizona, intends to establish at trial that Turi was encouraged by the State Department to engage in the actions for which he is now charged. Turi arranged to ship weapons to Libya via third-party countries to circumvent the U.N. arms embargo.\\n\\nThe Department of Justice agrees with defense counsel Cabou that no shipment of weapons by Turi ever occurred.\\n\\nThe Citizens’ Commission on Benghazi has alleged the State Department under Hilary Clinton’s direction was seeking to engage U.S. arms dealers in a secret scheme to deliver arms to Libya via intermediary countries such as Kuwait to mask the Obama administration’s apparent violation of U.N. Resolution 1973. Passed March 17, 2011, the resolution imposed a no-fly zone over Libya with the goal of establishing an embargo on arms shipments.\\n\\nIn July, WND reported a video showing the chief spokesman for the Gadhafi regime displaying to reporters a cache of weapons and ammunition seized from Qatar supported the Citizens Commission contention that the Obama administration “changed sides in the war on terror” in 2011 by facilitating the delivery of weapons to the al Qaida-dominated rebel militias attempting to overthrow Gadhafi.',\n",

       " ('\\n\\nOle Magga, Norwegian politician\\n\\nOn this blog I regularly get questions about the Sami (Lapp*). That’s because I often talk about Finnish genetics, have readers such as Clark who are of part-Sami origin, and, the provenance and character of the Sami speak to broader questions about the emergence of the modern European gene pool. More precisely questions about the Sami are relevant to the broader nature of the Finnic presence in Europe, and their relationship to other Baltic and northern populations. Are these people “indigenous” to Europe, or relatively newcomers (prehistoric Magyar or Turks).? These questions are prompted by the peculiarity of their languages (as well as the physical appearance of some of the Sami). With Basque they are the only living non-Indo-European European languages whose origins are prehistoric (Magyar and Turkish were arrivals within the last 1,000 years).**\\n\\nBecause of affinities to other Uralic languages which are found in Central Siberia it has often been conjectured that the Finns, Sami, and Estonians are relative newcomers to Norden from that region. This has some equivocal support from Y chromosomal lineages. On the other hand, there are those who argue that the Finnic peoples were present in the north of Europe before the arrival of Indo-European speakers (often these are Finnish nationalists). This has some support from maternal lineages. Naturally, some have been tempted to synthesize these two genetic lines of evidence, and the linguistic affinities, to argue that Finns are a hybrid population of Asiatic men and Paleolithic European women! But we need to go further than uniparental markers, the direct male and female ancestral lines. We need to look across the broader swath of the genome. It just happens that a new paper was published in The European Journal of Human Genetics on autosomal Sami affinities to other populations, A genome-wide analysis of population structure in the Finnish Saami with implications for genetic association studies:\\n\\nThe understanding of patterns of genetic variation within and among human populations is a prerequisite for successful genetic association mapping studies of complex diseases and traits. Some populations are more favorable for association mapping studies than others. The Saami from northern Scandinavia and the Kola Peninsula represent a population isolate that, among European populations, has been less extensively sampled, despite some early interest for association mapping studies. In this paper, we report the results of a first genome-wide SNP-based study of genetic population structure in the Finnish Saami. Using data from the HapMap and the human genome diversity project (HGDP-CEPH) and recently developed statistical methods, we studied individual genetic ancestry. We quantified genetic differentiation between the Saami population and the HGDP-CEPH populations by calculating pair-wise FST statistics and by characterizing identity-by-state sharing for pair-wise population comparisons. This study affirms an east Asian contribution to the predominantly European-derived Saami gene pool. Using model-based individual ancestry analysis, the median estimated percentage of the genome with east Asian ancestry was 6% (first and third quartiles: 5 and 8%, respectively). We found that genetic similarity between population pairs roughly correlated with geographic distance. Among the European HGDP-CEPH populations, FST was smallest for the comparison with the Russians (FST=0.0098), and estimates for the other population comparisons ranged from 0.0129 to 0.0263. Our analysis also revealed fine-scale substructure within the Finnish Saami and warns against the confounding effects of both hidden population structure and undocumented relatedness in genetic association studies of isolated populations.\\n\\nThey had 352 Sami samples, and looked at ~38,000 SNPs. For the questions they’re focusing on 38 K SNPs seems fine. That’s enough to smoke out inter-population variation. In their paper they compared the Sami to the HGDP populations using standard techniques. Assuming 7 ancestral populations in the data set, this what ADMIXTURE popped out:\\n\\nThere is a definite “eastern” affinity among the Sami. Interestingly, it is broken down into a major and minor component. The major one is what is found among the Han, while the minor one resembles Native Americans. The natural interpretation for this is that what one is seeing is the shadow of the circumpolar northern Eurasian populations which spanned eastern Europe to Siberia. In comparison with other European populations the Sami affinity with Russians is clear, though interestingly they lack the “blue” component which peaks in northwest South Asian populations, which the Russians have, and Sardinians and French Basque lack.\\n\\nTo the left you see a PCA which breaks out the top two components of genetic variation for the data set. The two axes seem to be roughly west-east, north-south. Whatever ancient affinities the Sami may have with Southern Europeans via mtDNA haplogroup U5, it is not evident in the total genome content. The position of the Sami between Russians and Orcadians (from north of Scotland) is probably attributable to the fact that the Sami share much genetically with other Scandinavians, who are closer to British populations than the Russians are.\\n\\nI’m not sure these analyses really shed any light on the on the questions I mentioned earlier. The authors themselves note that the “eastern” component of the ancestry in the Sami is probably very old, so they may be an ancient stabilized hybrid population, mostly indigenous with a non-trivial exogenous element. That does not tell us whether Finnic languages are indigenous to Europe, or whether they are indigenous to Central Siberia (indigenous here is in reference to the Indo-European languages). Additionally, there is the matter that for such fine-grained questions the HGDP sample is suboptimal as reference populations. Dienekes Pontikos points this out:\\n\\nIt is unfortunate that they included Native American HGDP populations, but did not include the most relevant published data on Siberians that I first used to study population structure across north Eurasia here and here and here. Hence, they discover a “Native American”-like component in Saami, which in all likelihood can be further resolved into Siberian-specific components utilizing the Rasmussen et al. dataset. The “closest approximation” to the East Eurasian component in Saami in the HGDP panel are the Yakuts, but finer-scale analysis (see my previous posts) reveals that the Yakuts are made up almost entirely of an Altaic-specific component tying them to Turkic, Mongol, and Tungusic populations, while the eastern component in European Finns, Vologda Russians and Chuvashs has relationships with Central Siberians such as Kets, Selkups, and Nganasans, all of which are missing in this paper.\\n\\nBelow is a re-edited ADMIXTURE plot from Dienekes:\\n\\nNote: There are many ways to spell Sami. They used two a’s, but I find that confusing, so I just used one in my text.\\n\\nCitation: Maki-Torkko, Elina, Aikio, Pekka, Sorri, Martti, Huentelman, Matthew J, & Camp, Guy Van (2010).

       " ('\\n\\nThankfully Paul Krugman can not only READ a Budget Plan -- he can call it \"a Fraud\" when need be:\\n\\nA Word From Those Who\\n\\nBy PAUL KRUGMAN, nytimes.com -- April 10, 2011\\n\\n[...] The [News] stories I have in mind say things like this: “There are those who criticize the Ryan plan, saying that it’s too radical/goes too far.” As a card-carrying member of Those Who, I protest. This is just wrong . People like me don’t say that the Ryan plan is too radical; we say that it’s a fraud. The spending cuts are largely fake , either because they’re just magic asterisks or because they wouldn’t survive politically; the revenue estimates are fake , because they combine huge tax cuts with vague assurances that extra revenue will be found by closing loopholes. There’s no there there -- except for big tax cuts for the rich and pain for the poor.\\n\\n[...] Anyway, no, I don’t think the plan goes too far. I think it’s disingenuous and fraudulent. And the reason I think that is that I have actually done the math.\\n\\nWhoa! Someone who gets PhD Economics -- is saying Paul Ryan\\'s latest Budget Plan is a Fraud. Who knew?\\n\\nApparently not many of the Pundits on the TV, heralding the Ryan Plan as pure gold; as Stone Tablets brought down from the Mountain ...\\n\\n\\n\\nWell you see, this is NOT the first time Paul K has had a chance to crunch the numbers being put \"out there\" by GOP wunderkind, Paul R ... the man with the Media Midas touch ...\\n\\nThe Flimflam Man\\n\\nBy PAUL KRUGMAN, nytimes.com -- August 5, 2010\\n\\n\\n\\nThe nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has, however, stepped into the breach. Its numbers indicate that the Ryan [Roadmap] plan would reduce revenue by almost $4 trillion over the next decade. If you add these revenue losses to the numbers The Post cites, you get a much larger deficit in 2020, roughly $1.3 trillion. [...] the [Paul Ryan] Roadmap wouldn’t reduce the deficit. All it would do is cut benefits for the middle class while slashing taxes on the rich. And I do mean slash. The Tax Policy Center finds that the Ryan plan would cut taxes on the richest 1 percent of the population in half, giving them 117 percent of the plan’s total tax cuts. That’s not a misprint. Even as it slashed taxes at the top, the plan would raise taxes for 95 percent of the population.\\n\\n[...] So why have so many in Washington, especially in the news media, been taken in by this flimflam? It’s not just inability to do the math, although that’s part of it. There’s also the unwillingness of self-styled centrists to face up to the realities of the modern Republican Party; they want to pretend, in the teeth of overwhelming evidence, that there are still people in the G.O.P. making sense. And last but not least, there’s deference to power — the G.O.P. is a resurgent political force, so one mustn’t point out that its intellectual heroes have no clothes.\\n\\nWow! Krugman can do Macro-Economics Math -- and take a fawning Media to task -- all in the same article, to boot. I knew there was a reason I like this guy!\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd this time around, Krugman is not alone in his deconstruction of the latest Ryan Talking Point Football. Ready ... Set ...

Good friends with Les Siegelman, he introduced Les\\'s brother, [former] Alabama Governor Don Siegelman to Richard Scrushy, a local Republican businessman. Because of this, White became inextricably intertwined with Siegelman, who was one of the biggest targets of the Rove-directed, heavily politicized Department of Justice [DOJ].\\n\\nScrushy and Siegelman were later indicted and convicted on charges stemming from that relationship. According to affidavits provided by Gary [and Judy, who was also in the room] White was asked to perjure himself before a Grand Jury in order to make the case against Siegelman and Scrushy. White refused and the very next day, the DOJ started delivering subpoenas to build a case against him. White is serving ten years and has been moved most recently to Federal Prison in Arkansas.

What\\'s on your mind today?\\n\\nJudy White: Prison employees, a unique breed of purely abusive beings. As we have discussed before, Forrest City employees are especially unprofessional in endless ways. Only at Forrest City have prison employees been allowed to come to \"work\" less professionally dressed than employees at Walmart or Waffle House or any fast-food restaurant. While taxpayers provide uniforms for federal prison employees, that\\'s just wasted money at Forrest City, where the prison employees are allowed to wear t-shirts and jeans, fishing hats and ball caps.\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nAnd while visitors are constantly and summarily - and illegally - denied visitation with their imprisoned loved ones at the whim of prison employees, those prison employees are allowed to exercise their First Amendment rights through statements on shirts that are abusive and demeaning to the prisoners for whom they are supposed to be setting positive examples. The BOP claims they do not allow the abuse of prisoners, assuring the public and the powers-that-be in Washington that they \"respect\" prisoners. What a lie.\\n\\nJB: What do you mean? Are you talking about something specific?\\n\\nJW: Last month, for instance, a federal prison employee in Forrest City had the poor judgment to wear a shirt proclaiming \"IF YOU BUILD IT\" - depiction of prison complete with razor wire - \"THEY WILL COME\", meaning prisoners, of course. The sentiment demonstrated by the shirt and its wearer is a perfect illustration of what prison employees are interested in: more prisons, more jobs and money for more and more prison employees/union members.\\n\\nIs that statement representative of our federal government, particularly at a time when the need for \"justice\" reform is moving to the front burner, in no small part because of the unaffordability of imprisoning more people than any other nation in the world? The shirt demonstrates not only disrespect and a demeaning attitude towards the prisoners and the public, but a narcissistic perspective that it\\'s all about jobs for prison employees. In fact, the federal prison\\'s only legitimate claim to success is at providing jobs for sociopaths and individuals who would be otherwise unemployable. With a dismal record of rehabilitating anyone and a high rate of recidivism that translates into \"We\\'ll leave the light on for you\" (as one prison employee told a man who had paid his debt to society and was being released), it is clear that prison employees understand that more and more prisoners are needed to provide more and more jobs for the \"prison industrial complex.\"\\n\\nAnyone who has the attitude expressed by the shirt should not work for the government in any capacity, and no one should be able to wear that shirt to any government job, least of all a job where they come into contact with prisoners. While there may be no help available for idiots, prisoners and the public would benefit from providing sensitivity training for prison employees. We would all benefit if prison employees actually fulfilled their responsibilities and did the jobs they are charged with doing, rather than working to ensure the constant flow of people into the prison system.\\n\\nJB: That\\'s a rather macabre T-shirt and I agree, quite inappropriate as well as disrespectful. What else is going on?\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nJW: There is so much! But let\\'s start with the constant issue of medical abuse and a strange new issue: paper plates. I can\\'t wait to share paper plates with you, but let\\'s start with medical, because of a recent development far from Forrest City. In New York City, a prison employee has been charged in the death of a prisoner after the guard failed to obtain medical care for that prisoner. [See this link.]\\n\\nJB: That\\'s awful. On the other hand, I\\'m glad that medical abuse is at least finally getting some media attention.\\n\\nJW: Since Gary\\'s self-surrender on September 29, 2010, he has never been provided proper or reasonable medical care. His medications have been repeatedly withheld for days, weeks or months at a time, placing his life and health in danger, and he has not been allowed to see or be seen by a doctor.

According to the Navy Times, the so-called “Gremlins” program involves building a transport and bomber-style aircraft capable of launching swarms of fighter drones mid-flight.\\n\\nHere’s the Navy Times:\\n\\nThe Defense Advanced Research Project Agency plans to demonstrate the ability to launch and recover swarms of drones from a C-130 sometime in 2019, according to statements by the agency and by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, one of two companies contracted to design prototype of the drones. The other is Dynetics. The test would serve as a major leap into the next phase of testing for DARPA’s Gremlins program.\\n\\nSince drone warfare is such an important component of contemporary US foreign policy, DARPA is expected to begin testing the program next year. The initiative – which DARPA says is named after the imaginary, mischievous imps that became good luck charms for British pilots in WWII - is intended to give the military “improved operational flexibility at a much lower cost than is possible with today’s expensive, all-in-one platforms,” according to a DARPA statement.\\n\\nOnce dispatched, the drones would be outfitted with different payloads in order to accomplish an assortment of missions, to include ISR, electronic warfare, signals intelligence and even kinetic effects.\\n\\n“When the gremlins complete their mission, a C-130 transport aircraft would retrieve them in the air and carry them home, where ground crews would prepare them for their next use within 24 hours,” the DARPA statement reads.\\n\\nThe program seeks to one day launch the drones from smaller fixed-wing fighter aircraft while still keeping those manned platforms out of the range of enemy air defenses. The program’s first phase concluded in March, and showed the program was not just feasible, but “would require minimal modification to the host aircraft,” said Scott Wierzbanowski, the DARPA program manager, in a statement.\\n\\nDuring the second phase, DARPA hopes to have a preliminary design completed, which would enable it to finish preliminary designs for full-scale technology demonstrations, Wierzbanowski said.\\n\\nEach drone would have a range of 300 nautical miles while carrying a 60-pound payload.\\n\\nDARPA is incorporating commercial technology to drive down the cost of the gremlins. The goal is for each drone to cost less than $500,000.\\n\\nSo far, there are two options for recovery systems. The first can be mounted on the wings of an aircraft, while the second is loaded in the cargo bay. DARPA wouldn’t say how many drones would fit on the aircraft’s wings.\\n\\nThe hope is that the gremlins could be reused up to about 20 times. In the end, the goal is for the drones to provide a cheaper alternative to larger aircraft platforms with heavier payloads and higher maintenance costs over their lifetimes.',\n",

       " ('\\n\\nThe extreme carnage that we are witnessing in the junk bond market right now is one of the clearest signals yet that a major U.S. stock market crash is imminent. For those that are not familiar with “junk bonds”, please don’t get put off by the name. They aren’t really “junk”. They simply have a higher risk and thus a higher return than other bonds of the same type. And yesterday, I explained why I watch them so closely. If stocks are going to crash, you would expect to see a junk bond crash first. This happened in 2008, and it is happening again right now. On Monday, a high yield bond ETF known as JNK crashed through the psychologically important 35.00 barrier for the very first time since the last financial crisis. On Tuesday, high yield bonds had their worst day in three months, and JNK plummeted all the way down to 34.44. When I saw this I was absolutely stunned. This is precisely the kind of junk bond crash that I have been anticipating that we would soon witness.\\n\\nNormally, stocks and junk bonds track one another very closely, but just like before the 2008 crash, they have become decoupled in recent months. Anyone that even has an elementary understanding of the financial world knows that this cannot continue indefinitely. And when they start converging once again, the movement could be quite violent.\\n\\nWhen I chose to use the word “carnage” to open this article, I was not exaggerating what is going on in the junk bond market one bit. On Tuesday evening, Jeffrey Gundlach used the exact same word to describe what is happening…\\n\\nJeffrey Gundlach, the widely followed investor who runs DoubleLine Capital, said on a webcast on Tuesday that the junk bond market has come under severe selling pressure ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting next week. “We are looking at real carnage in the junk bond market,” Gundlach said. Gundlach also said it was too early to buy high-yield junk bonds and energy debt securities. “I don’t like things when they go down every single day.”\\n\\nSometimes a chart can be extremely helpful in understanding what is going on. The following chart was posted by Zero Hedge on Tuesday, and it shows that yields on the riskiest junk bonds are heading into the stratosphere…\\n\\nAnd for those that are not familiar, it is important to note that when yields go up, bond prices go down. So the chart above is what a “crash” looks like.\\n\\nAnother “leading indicator” that I watch is the behavior of Dow Transports.\\n\\nDow Transports started crashing before the Dow Jones Industrial Average did back in August, and now it is happening again…\\n\\nDow Transports are in reverse. Down over 3% today, the biggest drop since the Black Monday collapse, Trannies are now below the lows of the Bullard bounce from October 2014 and down a shocking 16% in 2015. This would be the first four-quarters-in-a-row drop in Transports since 1994 and the worst year since 2008…\\n\\nIn addition, we are also seeing trouble signs erupt at major financial institutions just like we did during the run up to the 2008 crash. For example, I have been concerned about Morgan Stanley for quite a while, and on Tuesday we learned that they have just laid off more than a thousand workers…\\n\\nStruggling Morgan Stanley slashed 1,200 jobs around the world in recent days, a person familiar with the matter told CNNMoney. The cuts were broad-based and eliminated 25% of the positions within the fixed income and commodities businesses, the person said. Those divisions are grappling with tumbling trading revenue and shrinking fees. Morgan Stanley also eliminated about 730 back-office jobs like human-resources and IT positions.\\n\\nVirtually all of the things that we would expect to see just prior to a 2008-style stock market crash are happening right now.\\n\\nIf just two or three leading indicators were flashing red, we could have a really good debate about what they might mean.\\n\\nBut the fact that virtually all of the numbers are screaming a warning at us should mean that the debate is over. Anyone with an open mind should be able to very clearly see what is coming next.\\n\\nVery quickly, let me give you just 10 signs that indicate that we are right on the precipice of a major recession and a very substantial financial downturn…\\n\\n1. Global GDP growth has gone negative for the first time since 2009.\\n\\n2. Corporate earnings growth has turned negative.\\n\\n3. S&P 500 net profit margins are steeply declining. According to Tony Sagami, “since 1973, there has been only one 60 bps decline in S&P 500 net profit margin that didn’t lead to a recession.”\\n\\n4. In October, U.S. imports of goods declined by 6.6 percent on a year over year basis.\\n\\n5. In October, U.S. exports of goods declined by 10.4 percent on a year over year basis.\\n\\n6. U.S. manufacturing is contracting at the fastest pace that we have seen since the last recession.\\n\\n7. Corporate debt defaults have risen to the highest level that we have seen since the last recession.\\n\\n8. Credit card numbers that were recently released show that holiday sales have gone negative for the first time since the last recession.\\n\\n9. The velocity of money in the United States has dropped to the lowest level ever recorded.\\n\\n10. Of the 93 largest stock market indexes in the entire world, 47 of them (slightly more than half) have already plunged at least 10 percent year to date.\\n\\nJust like in 2008, other global financial markets are imploding ahead of a U.S. collapse.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down another 162 points, but we are still within 1000 points of the market peak that was set earlier this year. We are still in far better shape than most of the rest of the world, but that will soon change.\\n\\nI can’t think of a single leading indicator that is telling us that everything is going to be okay. All of the numbers are pointing to major trouble ahead. So I hope that you are being smart and doing what you can to get prepared while there is still time.',\n",

God created man and woman for a reason and this is an essential part of His plan of happiness for humankind. Sadly, whenever there is good as we know there tends to be evil. The reason for this particularly against the family is because this is where the potential for the most love and joy exists. Just as in politics those with less than honorable intentions purpose is character assassination so it is where the greatest cause of happiness exist so does Satan\\'s desire exist to take away the ability for humankind to enjoy life. The family his his single greatest threat. For those who claim because someone doesn\\'t agree with them means they hate them they are nothing more than schoolyard bullies trying to force their own beliefs upon others while hypocritically attacking those who simply follow the traditional and universally-held belief that a man and a woman who have children are what constitutes a family. This page has been, is and will ever always be for the love of the family. God bless the family!\\n\\nToday\\'s post was shared by a friend from a Facebook page called \" The Family - A Proclamation To The World .\" This group gets its name from a proclamation issued in 1995 by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the Salt Lake based, largest, and Romney variety of Mormons).\\n\\nTo be fair, this Facebook page is run by independent individuals and not by the church itself. But it serves to show how believers interpret the church\\'s position.\\n\\n—\\n\\nThe first thing we notice is the photo. A stock photo of a young, white, mostly blonde family. One man, one woman, one girl, one boy and (one assumes) one cat and one dog sitting at their feet.\\n\\nThey\\'ve chosen a stock photo to represent the ideal family. There is no color or variety here. This is how they see the world. No doubt the posters live in a suburb where everyone looks pretty much like this.\\n\\n(As an aside, the friend who shared this on Facebook is a white female, with a white husband, one daughter, one son, two dogs [no cats], and lives in a suburb where all her neighbors look like the photo... well with a few extra pounds on everybody.)\\n\\n—\\n\\n\\n\\nWe support civil unions this does not prevent anyone from living whatever lifestyle they choose but we believe strongly in the traditional, universally-held belief of a man and woman being required to constitute marriage.\\n\\nWe\\'ve all fallen victim to grammatical errors made in haste while posting. But come on! You are presenting your position to the world. Take a minute to proofread. Maybe even have a friend give it a once-over before you hit \"post.\"\\n\\nThe thing that jumps out at me from this first, hum... phrase? sentence? thought?... is the insular life these people live. Despite recent polls, these people live in a world with a \"universally held belief\" counter to the majority of real world Americans. It is not difficult to guess that the only gay people the posters know are firmly closeted with a wife and two kids (see photo above).\\n\\n—\\n\\n\\n\\nSadly, whenever there is good as we know there tends to be evil.\\n\\nOkay. They\\'ve said they support civil unions so people can live the lifestyle \"they choose.\" (Funny, I don\\'t remember choosing to be straight. How did my gay friends have the strength to counter those raging hormones of youth and choose a different lifestyle?) Anyway, in spite of their professed support of civil unions, it\\'s important to them to point out that teh gay is EVIL. Not just different. Not just wrong. Not even just sinful. EVIL. EVIL. EVIL.\\n\\nAnd this EVIL is directed against the family. As almost, but not quite coherently, expressed in this ... oh, hell, let\\'s go with... phrase:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe reason for this particularly against the family is because this is where the potential for the most love and joy exists.\\n\\nJust as in politics those with less than honorable intentions purpose is character assassination so it is where the greatest cause of happiness exist so does Satan\\'s desire exist to take away the ability for humankind to enjoy life.\\n\\nThe family his his single greatest threat.\\n\\nIt continues with, what I believe is, more about the family:I love this, not for its complete lack of resemblance to English, but for coming back to where this whole EVIL gay thing comes from in the first place: SATAN. Saturday Night Live\\'s Church Lady is alive and well, has joined the Mormon church and is posting on Facebook.We put these phrases about the family and evil and Satan together, run them through a language translator and assume the gist of what they are trying to say is that families are the be all and end all of happiness. And SATAN is using EVIL gayness to destroy the family and end any chance mankind has at happiness.\\n\\nI\\'ve never seen a satisfactory explanation of just exactly how marriage equality destroys heterosexual marriages and families. Yet this remains the big argument from the more Christlike than thou community.\\n\\nFunny. I\\'ve been married to my wonderful wife for 30 years. During that time tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of gay and lesbian couples have hooked up, shacked up, and gotten married. Not one of those relationships has had any affect whatsoever on our relationship. Somehow, I\\'ve fallen into a mindset where \"their\" (that is to say, anybody\\'s that isn\\'t ours) relationship is about them. And our relationship is about us.\\n\\nI guess I missed the memo where, all of a sudden, my relationship depends on other people not being allowed to have one of their own.\\n\\n—\\n\\n\\n\\nFor those who claim because someone doesn\\'t agree with them means they hate them they are nothing more than schoolyard bullies trying to force their own beliefs upon others while hypocritically attacking those who simply follow the traditional and universally-held belief that a man and a woman who have children are what constitutes a family.\\n\\nThis of course is the old \"I\\'m not a bully for withholding rights from you. You\\'re the bully for not letting me exercise my god-given right to discriminate against you\" argument. The fact that they can\\'t see it shows how wrapped up in their own persecution complex they are.\\n\\nCivil Rights are about protecting the minority from the majority. It is a rare thing to have a majority cede rights to a minority. That\\'s the whole why of the Bill of Rights and Civil Rights legislation and rulings. Because the minority needs to be, and deserves to be, protected from a bigoted majority.\\n\\n—\\n\\n\\n\\nThis page has been, is and will ever always be for the love of the family. God bless the family!\\n\\nThat is, families as WE define them (see the above photo). And WE resolutely deny the right of any Satan-inspired, evil gay people to have families of their own. WE deny them the right to find the love and happiness that comes with marriage and family .... because god.\\n\\n—\\n\\nREALLY?!?\\n\\nIf you honestly believe that marriage and family are god\\'s greatest avenue for finding lasting love and happiness in this world, wouldn\\'t you want that for all your brothers and sisters? for all god\\'s sons and daughters?\\n\\nHow sad it is that some people base their happiness on their ability to deny that happiness to others.',\n",

       " ('\\n\\nWhen financial markets crash, they do not do so in a vacuum. There are always patterns, signs and indicators that tell us that something is about to happen. In this article, I am going to share with you four patterns that are happening right now that also happened just prior to the great financial crisis of 2008. These four signs are very strong evidence that a deflationary financial collapse is right around the corner. Instead of the hyperinflationary crisis that so many have warned about, what we are about to experience is a collapse in asset prices, a massive credit crunch and a brief period of absolutely crippling deflation. The response by national governments and global central banks to this horrific financial crisis will cause tremendous inflation down the road, but that comes later. What comes first is a crisis that will initially look a lot like 2008, but will ultimately prove to be much worse. The following are 4 things that are happening right now that indicate that a deflationary financial collapse is imminent…\\n\\n#1 Commodities Are Crashing\\n\\nIn mid-2008, just before the U.S. stock market crashed in the fall, commodities started crashing hard. Well, now it is happening again. In fact, the Bloomberg Commodity Index just hit a 13 year low, which means that it is already lower than it was at any point during the last financial crisis…\\n\\nThe Bloomberg Commodity Index plunges to 13-year low, led by a drop in gold. http://t.co/03c3WYrlGe pic.twitter.com/8IY7TSVgk3 — Richard Bravo (@richbravo2) July 20, 2015\\n\\n#2 Oil Is Crashing\\n\\nOn Monday, the price of oil dipped back below $50 a barrel. This has surprised many analysts, because a lot of them thought that the price of oil would start to rebound by now.\\n\\nIn early 2014, the price of a barrel of oil was sitting above $100 a barrel and the future of the industry looked very bright. Since that time, the price of oil has fallen by more than 50 percent.\\n\\nThere is only one other time in all of history when the price of oil has fallen by more than $50 a barrel in such a short period of time. That was in 2008, just before the great financial crisis that erupted later that year. In the chart posted below, you can see how similar that last oil crash was to what we are experiencing right now…\\n\\n#3 Gold Is Crashing\\n\\nMost people don’t remember that the price of gold took a very serious tumble in the run up to the financial crisis of 2008. In early 2008, the price of gold almost reached $1000 an ounce, but by October it had fallen to nearly $700 an ounce. Of course once the stock market finally crashed it ultimately propelled gold to unprecedented heights, but what we are concerned about for this article is what happens before a crisis arrives.\\n\\nJust like in 2008, the price of gold has been hit hard in recent months. And on Monday, the price of gold absolutely got slammed. The following comes from USA Today…\\n\\nThe yellow metal has tumbled to a five-year low amid a combination of diminishing investor fears related to foreign headwinds in Greece and China, and stronger growth in the U.S. which is leading to a stronger dollar and coming interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. Investors have been dumping shares of gold-related investments as other bearish signs, such as less demand from China and the breaking of key price support levels, add up. Earlier today, an ounce of gold fell below $1,100 an ounce to $1,080, its lowest level since February 2010. Gold peaked around $1,900 an ounce back in 2011.\\n\\nFor years, I have been telling people that we were going to see wild swings in the prices of gold and silver.\\n\\nAnd to be honest, the party is just getting started. Personally, I particularly love silver for the long-term. But you have got to be able to handle the roller coaster ride if you are going to get into precious metals. It is not for the faint of heart.\\n\\n#4 The U.S. Dollar Index Is Surging\\n\\nBefore the U.S. stock market crashed in the fall of 2008, the U.S. dollar went on a very impressive run. This is something that you can see in the chart posted below. Now, the U.S. dollar is experiencing a similar rise. For a while there it looked like the rally might fizzle out, but in recent days the dollar has started to skyrocket once again. That may sound like good news to most Americans, but the truth is that a strong dollar is highly deflationary for the global financial system as a whole for a variety of reasons. So just like in 2008, this is not the kind of chart that we should want to see…\\n\\nIf a 2008-style financial crisis was imminent, these are the kinds of things that we would expect to see happen. And of course these are not the only signs that are pointing to big problems in our immediate future. For example, the last time there was a major stock market crash in China, it came just before the great U.S. stock market crash in the fall of 2008. This is something that I covered in my previous article entitled “Guess What Happened The Last Time The Chinese Stock Market Crashed Like This?”\\n\\nAs an attorney, I was trained to follow the evidence and to only come to conclusions that were warranted by the facts. And right now, it seems abundantly clear that things are lining up in textbook fashion for another major financial crisis.\\n\\nBut even though what is happening right in front of our eyes is so similar to what happened back in 2008, most people do not see it.\\n\\nAnd the reason why they do not see it is because they do not want to see it.\\n\\nJust like with most things in life, most people end up believing exactly what they want to believe.\\n\\nYes, there is a segment of the population that are actually honest truth seekers. If you have felt drawn to this website, you are probably one of them. But overall, most people in our society are far more concerned with making themselves happy than they are about pursuing the truth.\\n\\nSo even though the signs are obvious, most people will never see what is coming in advance.\\n\\nI hope that does not happen to you.',\n",

       " ('\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\"\\n\\n-George Orwell, Animal Farm\\'\\n\\nIn two days, the FDA and a federal judge are going to put a Kentucky farmer and grandfather, Samuel Girod, in jail for up to 68 YEARS with up to $3M in fines for charges related to selling a homemade herbal salve.\\n\\nFrom: http://www.kyfreepress.com/2017/03/updated-sam-girod-v-fda/\\n\\nSamuel Girod [G as in Gee: gi-ROD] and his family have been making and selling three all-natural herbal products for nearly 20 years.\\n\\nNo one has ever been harmed by the products; the Girods have pages of testimonials and scores of repeat customers.\\n\\nSimilar products are currently made and sold online worldwide (including on Amazon) by other people using the same or similar basic ingredients. The recipes are online as well, you can make them in your kitchen.\\n\\nIn 2001, an FDA agent informed Sam that his product labels were making medical claims regarding healing certain conditions. At the time, Sam’s label said, ““[g]ood for all skin disorders. Skin cancer, cuts, burns, draws, and poison ivy.”\\n\\nSam had to change his label, removing the skin cancer claim specifically, or do very expensive testing proving the claims. Sam changed the label, removing any reference to skin cancer.\\n\\nSam did not receive any further communication from the FDA until 2012 when someone called the FDA and reported that a store in MO was selling Sam’s products and that medical claims were being made.\\n\\nThe “medical claims” were in fact customer testimonials contained in a brochure about Sam’s products! These testimonials are no different than Amazon reviews.\\n\\nThen the FDA claimed to have found a MO customer who had been harmed by Sam’s bloodroot salve.\\n\\nIn early 2013, during the investigation on that claim, FDA agents went to Sam’s home and demanded a warrantless search. Wanting to be cooperative, Sam said OK on one condition: that no photographs were taken (the Amish are religiously opposed to photography). The agents said no problem, no photos.\\n\\nThen they got on the property, whipped out their cameras and took photos of everything.\\n\\nSeveral months later, the Girods discover that, not only has this customer never been identified or produced, the bloodroot salve this customer used was not even Sam’s!!!\\n\\nYet that judge put an injunction on Sam’s products with three stipulations:\\n\\nnone could be sold until all medical claims were removed (referring to the brochures);\\n\\nSam’s bloodroot salve could never be sold again EVER (1); and\\n\\nSam had to allow inspection of his property where the products were made FOR FIVE YEARS.\\n\\nSam complied with 1 and 2: he stopped selling the bloodroot salve and stopped using the brochures. He was not so compliant with the searches.\\n\\nIn late 2013, after the injunction, FDA agents came to do a second search. Sam informed them that nothing had changed since the first search 7 months earlier, and that, since they had lied and taken photos during the first search, they were not welcome to do a second.\\n\\nThe FDA agents had a Bath County Sheriff’s deputy along with them (as they are required since they are federal agents rather than state). This sheriff witnessed the entire event and eventually told the agents to leave the property. Which they did.\\n\\nThese three product sales are how Sam’s family made their living. They had been denied this right via an arbitrary regulation made up by a federal agency with no true jurisdiction in the states — and with NO VICTIM.\\n\\nSo the Girods started selling their products again. Then, in 2014, Sam started a legal private membership club and sold his products to members via that framework. Perfectly legal.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the FDA started criminal proceedings against Sam for disobeying the injunction (selling his products and refusing the search) plus two other very serious charges:\\n\\n1. The FDA agents claimed that, when they came for the 2nd search, Sam and his family threatened them with physical violence. That is ludicrous enough on the face of it. Plus, the Sheriff’s deputy testified under oath that absolutely no threats were made, that, essentially, the FDA agents lied under oath.\\n\\n2. The FDA also charged Sam with witness tampering. The witness who was supposedly tampered with? Read the eyewitness account of Mary Miller’s testimony, link below. (2)\\n\\nThe Trial 2.27.17\\n\\nThe Amish do not use lawyers as a rule and Sam did not. This is a decision made by the community, not just the accused. Apparently the Amish don’t trust lawyers. Imagine that.\\n\\nBecause he barely presented a defense against federal prosecutors for whom money and conscience are not problems, Sam was convicted on all counts. (3)\\n\\nThe judge ordered Sam to remain in jail until sentencing on 6/16/17. [apparently rescheduled to 6/30/17] He’s been in jail since 2/27/17.\\n\\nHad Sam had a good attorney, he would certainly have been acquitted on the most egregious counts (threatening federal agents and witness tampering). These charges were clearly manufactured solely to make Sam into a “real” criminal, with the FDA being the only victim.\\n\\nThe only other charges — selling “drugs” across state lines — were manufactured out of whole cloth as well. The FDA’s own tests proved that the products were not drugs, that they were made from all-natural ingredients!!! These charges should have been dismissed from the start.\\n\\nSam’s sentencing is 6/30 and he is looking at up to 68 years in prison and up to $3M in fines. This is essentially a life sentence for charges stemming from an innocent labeling infraction!\\n\\nNow, compare and contrast the prosecution of Girod\\'s case, above, with the complete lack of enforcement of the War Powers Resolution, in regards to the deployment of United States military forces in Syria and elsewhere.\\n\\nhttp://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-03-11/assad-calls-us-forces-syria-in…\\n\\nIn Syria, the US is currently working with an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias and its biggest focus at this moment is to encircle and ultimately capture the ISIS capital of Raqqa. This week, the U.S.-led coalition announced that around 400 additional U.S. forces had deployed to Syria to help with the Raqqa campaign and to prevent any clash between Turkey and Washington-allied Syrian militias that Ankara sees as a threat. Around 500 U.S. forces are already in Syria in support of the campaign against Islamic State, which this week added several hundred, marines who were recently caught on video as they prepare for the Raqqa offensive. Asked about a deployment of U.S. forces near the northern city of Manbij, Assad said: \"Any foreign troops coming to Syria without our invitation ... are invaders.\"\\n\\nUnlike the Amish grandfather\\'s herbal salve, President Trump\\'s illegal invasion of Syria has actually harmed others.\\n\\nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/news/syria-civilians-killed-us-coalition-airstri…\\n\\nDozens more civilians allegedly killed in U.S.-led strikes\\n\\n...various activists groups reported different casualty tolls, saying the U.S.-led coalition, which is waging war on ISIS, was likely behind the attacks. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) monitoring group said the strike hit the village of Akayrshi on Sunday night and that 12 women were killed. The activist-run, Raqqa Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, said the strike hit a convoy of farm workers and that 22 died.\\n\\nBelow is what The Library of Congress has to say about the War Powers Resolution. However, our congress is far too busy funding the FDA so it may prosecute Amish grandfathers, and receiving unlimited campaign contributions from pharmaceutical companies, weapons companies, and AIPAC, to bother to read, understand, and do the job they were supposedly elected by the American people to do.\\n\\nhttp://www.loc.gov/law/help/war-powers.php\\n\\nThe War Powers Resolution, Public Law 93-148, 87 Stat. 555, passed over President Nixon\\'s veto on November 7, 1973. The War Powers Resolution is sometimes referred to as the War Powers Act, its title in the version passed by the Senate. This Joint Resolution is codified in the United States Code (\"USC\") in Title 50, Chapter 33, Sections 1541-48.\\n\\nThe term \"Resolution\" can be misleading; this law originated as a Joint Resolution and was passed by both Houses of Congress pursuant to the Legislative Process, and has the same legal effect as a Bill which has passed and become a law. For more information on Bills and Joint Resolutions see this explanation of Congressional Forms of Action.\\n\\nThe Constitution of the United States divides the war powers of the federal government between the Executive and Legislative branches: the President is the Commander in Chief of the armed forces (Article II, section 2), while Congress has the power to make declarations of war, and to raise and support the armed forces (Article I, section 8). Over time, questions arose as to the extent of the President\\'s authority to deploy U.S. armed forces into hostile situations abroad without a declaration of war or some other form of Congressional approval. Congress passed the War Powers Resolution in the aftermath of the Vietnam War to address these concerns and provide a set of procedures for both the President and Congress to follow in situations where the introduction of U.S. forces abroad could lead to their involvement in armed conflict.\\n\\nConceptually, the War Powers Resolution can be broken down into several distinct parts. The first part states the policy behind the law, namely to \"insure that the collective judgment of both the Congress and the President will apply to the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities,\" and that the President\\'s powers as Commander in Chief are exercised only pursuant to a declaration of war, specific statutory authorization from Congress, or a national emergency created by an attack upon the United States (50 USC Sec. 1541).\\n\\nThe second part requires the President to consult with Congress before introducing U.S. armed forces into hostilities or situations where hostilities are imminent, and to continue such consultations as long as U.S. armed forces remain in such situations (50 USC Sec. 1542). The third part sets forth reporting requirements that the President must comply with any time he introduces U.S. armed forces into existing or imminent hostilities (50 USC Sec. 1543); section 1543(a)(1) is particularly significant because it can trigger a 60 day time limit on the use of U.S. forces under section 1544(b).\\n\\nThe fourth part of the law concerns Congressional actions and procedures. Of particular interest is Section 1544(b), which requires that U.S. forces be withdrawn from hostilities within 60 days of the time a report is submitted or is required to be submitted under Section 1543(a)(1), unless Congress acts to approve continued military action, or is physically unable to meet as a result of an armed attack upon the United States. Section 1544(c) requires the President to remove U.S. armed forces that are engaged in hostilities \"without a declaration of war or specific statutory authorization\" at any time if Congress so directs by a Concurrent Resolution (50 USC 1544 (external link)). Concurrent Resolutions are not laws and are not presented to the President for signature or veto; as a result the procedure contemplated under Section 1544(c) is known as a \"legislative veto\" and is constitutionally questionable in light of the decision of the United States Supreme Court in INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983). Further sections set forth expedited Congressional procedures for considering proposed legislation to authorize the use of U.S. armed forces, as well as similar procedures regarding proposed legislation to withdraw U.S. forces under Section 1544(c) (50 U.S. 1545-46a).\\n\\nThe fifth part of the law sets forth certain definitions and rules to be used when interpreting the War Powers Resolution (50 USC 1547 (external link)). Finally, the sixth part is a \"separability provision\" and states that if any part of the law is held (by a court) to be invalid, on its face or as applied to a particular situation, the rest of the law shall not be considered invalid, nor shall its applicability to other situations be affected (50 USC 1548 (external link)).\\n\\nU.S. Presidents have consistently taken the position that the War Powers Resolution is an unconstitutional infringement upon the power of the executive branch. As a result, the Resolution has been the subject of controversy since its enactment, and is a recurring issue due to the ongoing worldwide commitment of U.S. armed forces. Presidents have submitted a total of over 120 reports to Congress pursuant to the Resolution.\\n\\nIf we are not a nation of laws, then what are we?\\n\\nh_h',\n",

These are all from back in June. These comments in particular bring up issues of:\\n\\nBabysitting gate - requireing state paid workers to spend their time babysitting instead of working.\\n\\nIntimidation - of people beyond trooper commanders and issues beyond TrooperGate\\n\\nPoliticizing on the job - using state equipment and time to try and influence elections in the state\\'s Republican party.\\n\\nNow none of these have been confirmed thru independent research but for all those lawyers and reporters scouring the ground in Alaska they need to be looking into this stuff too.\\n\\n---------------------------\\n\\nBabysitting Palin\\'s children on the job\\n\\nCo-Governors Todd and Sarah are allegedly having state employees do the same for them Since co-Governor Sarah claims to have reformed state government with a strong executive branch ethics act, surely any babysitting services by Ivy and/or others must be a violation of that stringent law.\\n\\nBabysitting and Conducting Republican party work on government time\\n\\nIvy Frye and Frank Bailey work for co-Governors Todd and Sarah. They and Kris Perry were part of the original Palin Klan when Sarah began her campaign- they are the true believers. Ivy quit her job working for Lyda to work on the campaign, first as a volunteer and later as paid staff. She has bounced between the governor\\'s office and Annette \"Total Unrecall\" Kreitzer\\'s office. Ivy allegedly performs babysitting and other childcare services for the co-governors on state time. If so, this does not comply with state law. Frank does boards and commissions (which Ivy used to do). He apparently was responsible for checking Kopp\\'s background. He performed incompetently. He also pressured Monegan and other AST commanders to fire Wooten. He thinks he is smart- like when he uses personal e-mail accounts to conduct official business in an effort to shield the communication from disclosure. He will soon find out that theory doesn\\'t hold water. They were allegedly up to their eyeballs in doing exactly what co-Governor Sarah complained about Ruedrich doing- conducting Republican party work on state time. I\\'ve been told by multiple sources that on behalf of the co-governors they were calling delegates to the Republican convention to dump Ruedrich- and that it\\'s common knowledge. They have never denied doing so.\\n\\nSome notes on the above. Lyda is Lydia Green the senior rep of the Alaskan Republican party and currently arch-enemies with Gov. Palin. Kopp is the Trooper Commission Palin hired (and fired 2 weeks later)who had been removed from a supivisory role in his last employment for sexual harassment.\\n\\nIt has been well-known for some time that the friends and associates of Halcro, Ramras, and Green have also been identified and scrutinized and sometimes heckled and personally smeared by the Palin Klan. The net of executive pressure and scrutiny has extended outward to Palin operatives not included on the e-mail register. These individuals include many such as Linda Menard, Chuck Heath (Palin\\'s father), and Janet Kincaid in the valley.\\n\\nPerhaps we need to re-evaluate the unusually large powers we give our Executive branch that other states don\\'t.\\n\\nOh!

Back then it was a constant beating of the drums on the front page and the front page of Section B (which then was the section for State news). Article after article, day after day - Randy had used his state computer during lunch break and had sent a confidential email/info to an oil company he was overseeing. The dogs weren\\'t called off by the ADN til he resigned, and investigation commenced, and he was fined $12,000.\\n\\nIf the McCain camp did an internet search I wonder if they ran across any of this?',\n",

       " ('\"Businesses are job creators, so we can\\'t [tax them more, regulate them to protect consumers or the environment, etc. etc. ad nauseum]\"...\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is a self-serving post hoc rationalization by those who own or run businesses, and the legislators and public officials who depend on them for campaign contributions. It is reliably invoked every time the possibility is mentioned of raising taxes on these people, who by and large are the wealthiest among us, in order to scare the electorate into believing that this class of people makes its hiring decisions based upon how much they are taxed (they don’t). It is invoked no matter how much money businesses are already sitting on (collectively about $1.6T at the moment for corporate America, which is somewhat less than the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined have cost us, to date). It is invoked no matter how low their tax rate already is (the lowest in about 60 years, they tell me). It is a post hoc rationalization, because it is invoked only after business owners have decided they simply don’t want to pay any more in taxes, and want to make sure that they have friends in high public places who will insure that they don’t have to. Therefore, they need an argument that will sway the opinions of those who don’t own or run businesses but who (a) vote and (b) need jobs.\\n\\nBusiness is good for society. A healthy economy is known by a thriving business climate. Many, many positive things can be attributed to businesses, but there is one property that a business owner can never claim: businesses (and by extension those who own businesses) do not create jobs, and never have.\\n\\nWhat businesses create are profits for their owners. That is their function, and there is nothing inherently wrong with that, so long as they are making an honest profit and not doing it by externalizing their costs for others to pay, or by exploiting workers or consumers. But businesses do not create jobs. Demand for what a business sells – that’s what creates jobs, or at least, it can. Only if there is unmet demand in the market for what a business sells will the business owner(s) contemplate hiring someone to help fill the demand, but that’s not the first thing they will try. This can be understood by reference to the fact that labor costs are nearly always the biggest drain on the bottom line profitability of a business. Indeed, all the incentives line up against hiring someone for a real, decent-paying, full-time position with adequate benefits unless all other options for meeting unmet demand have first been exhausted. And there are plenty of options for the business owner.\\n\\nFirst, they will try to increase the productivity of their existing work force. Higher quotas, longer hours. Then they might turn to technology – automation, software, and such, to boost productivity. If that’s not sufficient and they need more actual human labor, they may try to outsource that labor abroad, where it costs much less. Failing that, they will take on temps, hire people as independent contractors, and/or hire only part-timers to avoid having to pay benefits. They will push out older, more experienced workers to offset the cost of younger new hires.\\n\\nIf, and only if, all of these options (and more I have not mentioned) have been exhausted, and there remains unmet demand in the market which the business can profitably satisfy, then a business owner might create a job or jobs. Real, full-time, living-wage jobs with benefits. And – surprise! – these jobs will last just as long as that demand does. And once demand fluctuates back downward (an inevitability of the business cycle), here come the layoff pink slips. This calculus and no other is responsible for job creation, and applies not only to entrepreneurs or existing businesses, but also those looking for investment opportunities in the business world. Indeed, hiring someone is less an act of “job creation” by business owners than an act of investment in the likelihood of future profitability.\\n\\nTo top it all off, if a given business is incorporated, the directors in fact are legally bound by a fiduciary duty to behave in exactly this way, if doing so is in the best interest of the company (which is defined as return on shareholder investment, i.e., profitability).\\n\\nThe argument is also absurd in terms of tax policy, which coincidentally is the primary forum where this myth rears its ugly head (the others being discussion of regulations on business). A business that has to pay more in taxes is by definition a business that is making more profits. By definition, it’s a good problem to have. Given all the ways that businesses can write off expenses, if after exhausting all of them a business owner still has a substantial tax liability on the profits, it can only mean that there are substantial profits being made in the first place. Continuing to complain about the tax burden in such circumstances, especially using such a disingenuous argument as the “job creator” myth, is evidence simply of greed and a contemptible aversion to giving something back for the upkeep and improvement of the societal structures and institutions that made that business owner’s success possible in the first place.\\n\\nPsychologically, it’s also evidence of narcissism, specifically the portion of that character flaw that posits an inflated sense of self-importance. What I mean is, the “job-creator’ myth goes hand in hand with the “self-made man/woman” myth indulged in by those who amass fortunes in business that would not have been possible without the contributions of the society they live in - contributions that are paid for by everybody via taxes. Some examples of these might include roads, free public education, state-subsidized college, a stable currency, public safety officers, and a judicial system. All of these things and many more make it possible to operate a successful business in this country; without them businesses and the economy cannot possibly thrive (see Somalia for evidence of this). But there are those who are psychologically incapable of crediting the contributions of anyone but themselves for their success in business. This is one side of the famous Fundamental Attribution Error, a cognitive bias in reasoning and attribution that finds its ultimate expression in the detestable pseudo-philosophy of Ayn Rand so popular among Republican politicians and CEOs. There is no such thing as a self-made man. I have never yet failed to be able to demonstrate that this is true, no matter whose name is offered. Certainly, success in business requires the business owner to work hard, and I’d never say otherwise. The fallacy lies in the assumption that the hard work of the successful business owner is not only necessary to achieve success (it is), but by itself sufficient (it isn’t).\\n\\nTo recap: Businesses don’t create jobs. Demand creates jobs. Money in people’s pockets creates demand.\\n\\nI know I’m preaching to the choir here, and the ideas I’m presenting are hardly original even on these pages. If you’re reading something in this diary that sounds like a regurgitation of something you wrote, or have read here before, you’re probably right, and I’ll gladly update link back to anyone’s work on this topic that predates this diary. What’s different this time is the urgency and salience of the topic. John Boehner is about a week and change away from crashing the full faith and credit of the United States of America, and probably the world economy along with it, and is justifying doing so by invoking this stupid, and demonstrably false argument, with a straight face no less. Folks, he’s getting away with it. This “job creators” rhetoric is crystallizing as the conventional wisdom, even among Democrats, at precisely the time when real, reality-based, job creation initiatives are desperately needed and being ignored. We can’t let that happen. It’s time for progressives, Democrats, and people with calculators to start pushing back on this argument aggressively every time and every place it is offered.\\n\\n\\n\\nWOW.

Do people still listen to Tom Lehrer? The composer of such uplifting odes as \"I Got It from Agnes,\" \"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park,\" and \"The Masochism Tango,\" he somehow managed to be the man Groucho Marx would have been if Groucho Marx had been a Harvard mathematics instructor--which makes it all the stranger that he risked plagiarizing from me these lines about plagiarism.\\n\\nOf course, in its way, the theft merely proves my timeless originality. It\\'s a compliment, really, that much of what I do is claimed by others. So influential are my thoughts and phrasings that a great number are actually pre-stolen--taken by other writers before I can even get around to thinking or saying them.\\n\\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife--that was me.\\n\\nThe square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the two shorter sides--also me.\\n\\nI saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, / dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix--me, me, me.\\n\\nBut I repeat myself. Last week I picked up a copy of Richard A. Posner\\'s latest little book, The Little Book of Plagiarism. Posner is a federal circuit judge who seems to publish books more often than the average person can read them, and he wants to exempt lawyers and judges from the charge of copying. It\\'s not their job to make their work original; it\\'s their job to make their work right. So if one lawyer copies another\\'s compelling argument, or a judge uses a clerk to write a strong opinion, there should be no complaint. But in the arenas of academic writing, journalism, and popular book publishing, The Little Book of Plagiarism takes a common sense view of the subject: Plagiarism is more a violation of professional ethics than a criminal offense; there\\'s a difference between allusion and theft; the new electronic media make plagiarism simultaneously easier to commit and easier to catch, etc.\\n\\nAlong the way, Posner glances at many of the plagiarism scandals of recent years. There was, for instance, Laurence Tribe, the Harvard law professor who borrowed material for his history of Supreme Court nominations. And Charles J. Ogletree, another Harvard law professor, who bulked up his book on the Brown decision with copied pages. And Kaavya Viswanathan, the Harvard undergraduate who plagiarized passages in the chick-lit novel for which she had received a $500,000 advance. And Doris Kearns Goodwin, the Harvard overseer who stole portions of her bestselling histories. (\"Fight fiercely, Harvard, fight, fight, fight! / Demonstrate to them our skill,\" as Tom Lehrer once urged his alma mater. \"Albeit they possess the might, / Nonetheless we have the will.\")\\n\\nWhat\\'s curious is how many of these recent stories of plagiarism were first aired in THE WEEKLY STANDARD. And how often Judge Posner fails to acknowledge THE WEEKLY STANDARD for the material on which he relies (except for one passing claim that the liberal Goodwin may have survived the revelation of her scholarly sins because it was a conservative magazine that carried the story about them).\\n\\nOf course, those of us working the vineyards are used to others drinking the wine. Still, a little credit every once in a while would be nice. Particularly when so much of what one wants to write has been pre-stolen.

       " ('\"True threat\" jurisprudence is used to determine whether statements constitute a threat or political rhetoric because the First Amendment protects political rhetoric but does not protect threats. Courts need to determine whether statements constitute a true threat because some statutes prohibit threats -- such as statutes governing threats against the President, or law enforcement officers, or threats to doctors at abortion clinics. The rationale for this law is to protect individuals from the \"fear of violence, from the disruption that fear engenders, and from the possibility that the threatened violence will occur.\"\\n\\nThis true threat analysis is instructive with the Tucson shootings and the past few years of right-wing extremism not to make a legal case, but to illustrate that the visual, oral and text statements that we have witnessed over the past few years constitute threats and not simply political hyperbole or rhetoric. We need to recognize a distinction between threats and political rhetoric, and find ways to at least deter the continued use of threats as a political tool to determine policy and voting choices.\\n\\nPlanned Parenthood of the Columbia/Willamette Inc. v. American Coalition of Life Activists (2002) (a long opinion with overview of cases in true threat jurisprudence) is a case involving websites and WANTED posters that provided photos, names, and addresses of abortion providers that were targeted, similar to Palin\\'s website. The case is instructive in terms of what key factors are used to determine whether statements constitute a true threat:\\n\\n1. The statement does not have to contain a threat on its face in order to constitute a \"true threat.\" For example, the infamous \"WANTED\" posters used by anti-abortion groups did \"not contain a threat on their face.\" A \"true threat\" is defined as a statement for which a \"reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by those to whom the maker communicates the statement as a serious expression of intent to harm.\" I think a reasonable person would foresee that Palin\\'s target map, reload tweets and identification of Gabrielle Giffords as a target would be interpreted as a serious expression of intent to harm Gabby even if by third parties given the context of the past few years of extremist threats to lawmakers and the knowledge that similar suggested threats have been linked to third parties taking or threatening to take harmful actions.\\n\\nLawmakers know that some of these so-called benign threats contributed or caused third persons to threaten to implement the suggested threat. For example, conservative Joyce Kaufman stated at Tea Party rally that \"if ballots don\\'t work, bullets will.\" An investigation found that a \"countywide school alert\" was implemented because her statement caused one person to threaten \"something big around the government building\" and another person to threaten to \"go to a school and open fire with a gun.\" The question is not should we charge Palin with a crime, but should we call her statements threats.\\n\\n2. Threat cases involve analysis of the \"whole factual context\" and \"all of the circumstances.\" Symbols can be important to determine whether a statement constitutes a threat. Indeed, history can give meaning to a threat, particularly for objects or methods used as symbols to convey the threat. For example, an anti-abortionist who parked two Ryder trucks in the driveways of an abortion clinic constituted a true threat because \"Ryder truck had been used in the Oklahoma City bombing of the Murrah Federal Building. Hart knew the clinicians knew this and would fear for their lives.\"\\n\\nPalin\\'s target map needs to be assessed in light of the full context of circumstances. In August 2009, when there were demonstrations against the health care measure across the nation, protesters showed up at events carrying guns. In January 2010, Sharron Angle raised the possibility of \"Second Amendment remedies.\" There were many videos, posters and statements referencing the threat of guns if lawmakers did not defeat the health care bill. In March 2010, the FBI confirmed that a gas line was deliberately cut at the home of Representative Perriello\\'s brother. It was speculated that a tea party website listed the brother\\'s address by mistake when it encouraged tea party supporters to \"drop by\" and \"express their thanks\" for his health-care vote.\\n\\nIt was within this broader context that Palin launched a website to \"Take Back the 20\" on September 23, 2010. \"Palin puts a bull\\'s-eye on 20 House districts under a headline that reads, \\'We\\'ve diagnosed the problem...Help us prescribe the solution.\\'\" Palin\\'s Democratic targets included Gabrielle Giffords and Virginia Rep. Tom Perriello.\\n\\nPalin now claims the crosshairs were surveryor\\'s marks, but what kind of surveyor tools require reloading? After health care bill passed, Palin tweeted \"\"Don\\'t Retreat, Instead - RELOAD!\"\\n\\n3. The context is not limited to the statement made on a website or poster, but includes the factual consequences that might occur over months and even a year. The court evaluated the history and use of \"wanted\" and \"unwanted\" posters with doctors\\' names, photographs, addresses and other personal information that were published before doctors were killed in March 1993, August 1993 and July 1994 in order to determine if the current case involving a \"Deadly Dozen poster\" constituted a true threat. The \"day after the Deadly Dozen poster was released, the FBI offered protection to doctors identified on it and advised them to wear bulletproof vests and take other security precautions, which they did.\"\\n\\nIt was important to the court that a \"\\'wanted\\'-type poster would likely be interpreted as a serious threat of death or bodily harm by a doctor in the reproductive health services community who was identified on one, given the previous pattern of \\'WANTED\\' posters identifying a specific physician followed by that physician\\'s murder.\" That is, the prior pattern of WANTED posters published followed by the assassination of doctors was important to interpreting the meaning of similar posters in a different case to determine whether it constituted a threat.\\n\\nThus, when evaluating whether a particular statement constitutes a threat, it is reasonable to consider the overall climate of hatred, fear and racism exhibited in the statements, videos and pictures presented by others because a particular statement is not interpreted in isolation.\\n\\n4. Patterns, symbols and code words are part of the factual context. In the abortion cases, the posters did not contain any language that was overtly threatening. Rather, it was the use of the wanted poster type format in the context of a prior pattern that similar posters were published and then followed by murder that constituted the threat. \"The posters are a true threat because, like Ryder trucks or burning crosses, they connote something they do not literally say, yet both the actor and the recipient get the message.\" The same is true of posters where \"lines were drawn through the names of doctors who provided abortion services and who had been killed or wounded.\"\\n\\nLawmakers themselves realize that the climate of hate includes threats. Rep. King (R-N.Y) proposed a gun ban perimeter around lawmakers to protect them. Two lawmakers now plan to \"pack heat back home.\" Wonder how many lawmakers will seek to be deputized by the U.S. Marshals Service, like Sen. Orrin Hatch has been for some years, so that they can \"carry a concealed handgun anywhere, including inside a federal building like the U.S. Capitol.\" Should we return to the days of the 1830s When Congress Was Armed And Dangerous? It is hard for lawmakers to argue that these statements are benign political rhetoric rather than cancerous climate of threats when they are concerned about their own safety.\\n\\nCharacterizing appropriate extremist statements as threats comports with the reality that some third parties have acted consistent with the suggested threats. It labels the conduct as inappropriate rather than politics as usual. If bloggers and the public call the statements threats, then it might provide some deterrence to the GOP to stop feeding the proliferation of threats by their silence or acceptance.',\n",

[. . .] Today the question people are debating properly is how do you feel about absorbing a blow that is from a weapon of mass destruction and it\\'s not 100 people or 1,000 people but it\\'s tens of thousands of people?\\n\\nPress Briefing, November 13, 2003:\\n\\nWhat hasn\\'t evolved is our desire to transfer sovereignty to the Iraqi people and security responsibilities to the Iraqi people at a pace that they\\'re comfortable with and capable of absorbing those responsibilities for themselves.\\n\\nTestimony before the 9-11 Commission, March 23, 2004 (pdf):\\n\\nTerrorism is a form of warfare, and must be treated as such. As with other forms of conflict, weakness invited aggression. Simply standing in a defensive position, absorbing blows, is not enough. Terrorism must be deterred.\\n\\nThe person speaking in each of these quotes is Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.\\n\\nThe MOQUOL--I Can Save You, America!',\n",

       " ('\"Why the US Needs a Single Payer Health System\" by David U. Himmelstein, MD & Steffie Woolhandler, MD, available at the Physicians for a National Health Program website: www.pnhp.org\\n\\nFrom the Drs. article:\\n\\n\"According to U.S. Congress\\' General Accounting Office, administrative savings from a single payer reform would total about 10% of overall health spending. These administrative savings, about $100 billion annually, are enough to cover all of the uninsured, and virtually eliminate co-payments, deductibles and exclusions for those who now have inadequate plans - without any increase in total health spending.\\n\\n\"A few giant firms own or control a growing share of medical practice. The winners in the new medical marketplace are determined by financial clout, not medical quality. The result: three or four hospital chains and managed care plans will soon corner the market, leaving physicians and patients with few options. Doctors who don\\'t fit in with corporate needs will be shut out, regardless of patient needs.\"\\n\\nIn \"The Plan,\" Rahm and Bruce scarcely mention Single Payer (which works admirably well in Canada), except for a few comments like this:\\n\\n\"[Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel (Rahm\\'s brother!)] and Fuchs remind us that those who long for a single-payer system or the sweeping safety nets of other nations should not forget why presidents as diverse as Harry Truman and Richard Nixon couldn\\'t enact them: `We should not confuse what we desire and think would be best for the country with what is consonant with deeply ingrained values.\\' ... [Drs.] Emanuel and Fuchs proposed an approach consistent with those values: `a voucher system for universal health care,\\' which would provide every American under sixty-five a voucher for basic health services from the insurance company or health plan of his or her choice.\"\\n\\nSo there we have it: Rahm and Bruce are worried about advocating Single Payer because that would oppose certain \"values.\" [Is this a GOP buzzword, which Democrats are trying to adopt?] Let\\'s be very clear about why meaningful national health care reform has been denied in this country. Instead of the word \"values,\" I\\'m thinking of the word \"priorities.\"\\n\\nRahm and his cronies (Dem & GOP alike) care a lot more about the wishes of the pharmaceutical and insurance industries, and the private medical care providers (for example, HMOs) than they do about insuring Americans. \"The Plan\" has this telling quote from Rahm\\'s brother and Dr. Fuchs:\\n\\n\"...the United States is a land of opportunity, not economic security; our commitment is to equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome.\"\\n\\nUsually elitists talk like this when opposing some type of welfare which helps the many, but not other types of welfare which help the few (for example, federal bailouts when big corporations get into trouble).\\n\\nSo that\\'s what Rahm and Bruce are offering: a voucher covering \"basic\" (whatever that is) health services while being careful to include \"the insurance company or health plan of his or her choice.\" Gotta keep the insurance companies involved to assure future campaign contributions. Gotta keep our (Congressional) priorities straight.\\n\\nMy reaction is:\\n\\n\"Good citizens, you need a better class of people representing you in Congress, instead of representing special interests. The two main parties will always try to play off each other to gain political advantage for themselves and greater control over you. You need genuine, non-aligned independents working on your behalf. You could start by electing one as President - me. One of my campaign promises is to `veto every single bill from Congress that comes my way until they pass:\\n\\n1) a comprehensive national Single Payer style health care reform package (similar to Canada\\'s) and\\n\\n2) a nationwide cap on credit care interest rates [\"The Plan\" doesn\\'t talk about that at all].\\'\\n\\nYou will have a far greater chance of seeing meaningful health care reform if I become your next president than you will if anybody else does.\\n\\nSteven Searle for US President in 2008\\n\\nThe only candidate with a contract: You wouldn\\'t sell your house without a contract; why give your vote away?\\n\\nwww.BestPartyAvailable.org\\n\\nbpa_cinc@yahoo.com',\n",

       " ('\\'Evolution\\' Advertisement Refutes Evolution Metaphor\\n\\nBY BRIAN THOMAS, M.S. * | WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 26, 2011\\n\\nOn a Dallas highway near the Institute for Creation Research offices, a billboard advertising a new computer reads, \"The laptop has just evolved.\" Likely, the statement is not meant to be taken in a literal Darwinian sense, since laptops are the product of human engineering. Why, then, is the word \"evolved\"—typically used to describe a natural process—used in the advertisement?\\n\\nTechnical-minded evolutionary biologists have different definitions of \"evolution,\" but on the street this term can carry the generalized meaning of onward and upward advancement from simple to complex forms or functions. Plainly, it is this concept to which the advertisement appeals.\\n\\nThe message is, \"if you want the latest pinnacle of technology, then buy this product. It is the most evolved, or advanced, to date.\" So, evolution is equated with advancement. The means, or \"how,\" behind such progress is, however, not explained.\\n\\nBut the way this technology became \"advanced\" contrasts with the way that Darwinian evolution supposedly transformed the living world from \"simple\" to \"advanced,\" and this falsifies the metaphor. Real-life personal design actually went into the advertised product, from its mental conception through its production and marketing. Highly refined machines like computers could never assemble themselves or be the result of random forces. Complicated, advanced systems in the living world must likewise have shared a similar history of personal design.\\n\\nA different advertisement promoting the engineering department of a nearby university stated \"cool stuff doesn\\'t just make itself,\" implying that \"cool stuff\" is purposefully engineered. It never happens naturally.\\n\\nThe tablet computer advertised on the billboard is \"cool stuff.\" It is not a product of nature, but was made by technicians. Body cells and other living systems are also \"cool stuff,\" but far more complicated than any man-made computer. They must therefore have come from the ultimate Technician.\\n\\nThe billboard\\'s application of the word \"evolved\" to something that is clearly the result of intelligent engineering offers an ironic commentary on evolutionary biology\\'s similar misuse of the term to explain clearly engineered life.\\n\\n* Mr. Thomas is Science Writer at the Institute for Creation Research.\\n\\nArticle posted on January 26, 2011.',\n",

       " ('\\'Wildly Unexpected\\' Galaxies Defy Simple Naturalistic Explanations\\n\\nBY BRIAN THOMAS, M.S. * | MONDAY, JUNE 27, 2011\\n\\nGod said in Isaiah 45:12: \"I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.\" 1 Corinthians 15:41 states, \"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.\" If what the Bible says is true, then planets, stars, and galaxies should each be unique, thus defying a simple origins explanation based on physical laws.\\n\\nThis truth is already well-established with the solar system, since each planet has a totally unique chemical composition and overall layout.1 And the discovery of \"old\" galaxies mixed with \"young\" shows that galaxy formation has been hopelessly difficult for nature-only theories to explain.2 Could creation be the best explanation for all these one-of-a-kind stellar entities?\\n\\nThe June 13, 2011, issue of New Scientist magazine summarized recent work by astronomer John Kormendy of the University of Texas at Austin and cosmologist Jim Peebles of Princeton University, as well as others. Astronomers are finding evidence that, according to Peebles, shows that \"galaxies are complicated and we don\\'t really understand how they form. It\\'s really an embarrassment.\"3\\n\\nIn the January 2011 issue of Nature, Peebles summarized two papers that described galaxy discs that totally failed to fit the standard theories of how galaxies supposedly formed.4 The galaxies they investigated had very dense points of mass in the center of their cores, presumably black holes. But only about half of them had a \"bulge\" of associated stars nearby. The other galaxies were razor-flat in side profile, even though they appeared brighter near their centers.\\n\\n\"Bulgeless\" galaxies are \"wildly unexpected in the standard model,\" according to Peebles.3 He wrote in Nature, \"A challenge for the advancing power of theoretical methods is to understand this inward migration of matter, and why it preferentially fed the pseudobulge [concentration of stars within the galaxy\\'s plane] in some galaxies and the black hole in others.\"4 In other words, why would matter have bulged beyond the plane of some spiral or disc galaxies, while in otherwise similarly shaped galaxies it remained confined within the flat plane of the galaxy?\\n\\nThey found a large number of \"slimline\" galaxies in \"pristine spirals.\" These are a \"big problem\" because, as Kormendy told New Scientist, \"We don\\'t know how to prevent bulge formation when galaxies grow big via mergers.\"3 Part of the standard model is that early on, small proto-galaxies crashed into one another to become today\\'s massive galaxies—a conjecture that lacks observational verification. But even the conjecture holds that such crashes make messes and bulges, whereas close to half of the galaxies they observed are clean and flat.\\n\\nOne aspect of slimline galaxies, like the Milky Way and Galaxy M101, that was not discussed is how young they look. Wouldn\\'t their billions of stars have had ample opportunity over billions of years to collide, especially in dense regions? At least some, but probably most, of those stars should have been bumped out of the galactic plane. But instead, their arrangement is as orderly as so many ink dots on a vast sheet of paper. Similar observations show that Saturn\\'s razor-flat rings look young.5\\n\\nThis thin, youthful appearance is no problem for the Bible\\'s recent creation account. And the mixture of bulged and \"no bulge\" galaxies is easy to explain as the handiwork of a Creator who crafted a unique signature for each of His cosmological formations.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nImage credit: NASA/JPL/Caltech\\n\\n* Mr. Thomas is Science Writer at the Institute for Creation Research.\\n\\nArticle posted on June 27, 2011.',\n",

WND features these reports to counterbalance the virtual blackout by the rest of the media due to their concerns that reporting such incidents would be inflammatory or even racist. WND considers it racist not to report racial abuse solely because of the skin color of the perpetrators or victims.) Videos linked or embedded may contain foul language and violence.\\n\\nThe threat of a repeat of black mob violence on the Fourth of July is causing at least three cities to cancel their annual Independence Day fireworks parties.\\n\\nBlack mob violence has marred for several years the annual holiday celebrations in the Cleveland suburb of Bedford. Almost none of which made its way to the local media. But the city council heard an earful from local residents following last year’s holiday violence.\\n\\nThey reported that 50 to 80 black people were hitting people in the face and disrupting the festival and surrounding areas.\\n\\n“Police officers used pepper ball pellets and a taser,” said city council minutes from a special meeting in August 2012. “Even the Wal-Mart and Get-Go store had to be closed for three hours.”\\n\\n“The mayor was shocked by what he had witnessed,” said the minutes. The mayor assured the audience that Bedford was “not the only city that had these types of problems.” People were “traveling from city to city just causing problems.”\\n\\nBecause Bedford no longer has a daily newspaper, the city sent out a “Code Red” message warning residents of the violence and lawlessness that was “out of control” at their event. Three surrounding police agencies were called in to quell the violence.\\n\\nThe fire chief said his people were not armed or trained for this kind of activity.\\n\\nSome of the residents complained of “political correctness” that prevented them from talking about what really happened. City manager Henry Angelo did not deny that black mobs were responsible for the violence. But he did say it was “contemptuous” that anyone would notice.\\n\\nIn 2009, Bedford went through the same public examination after similar violence the year before: Said one local columnist at Cleveland.com:\\n\\nBut there was an elephant in the room that was only barely acknowledged and it had nothing to do with money, nor the reticence of Bedford Heights. Following the fireworks display in 2008, groups of teenagers, many from Maple Heights, Warrensville Heights and Cleveland, started fights in incidents that some who were there said was tantamount to a riot.\\n\\nBedford is known as the home of Archibald MacNeal Willard, the artist who created the iconic fife and drum painting, “Spirit of ’76.” But in the end, even Willard could not save the fireworks of Bedford and the city council canceled it after deciding it was just too dangerous.\\n\\nAnother Cleveland suburb, Shaker Heights, also canceled Fourth of July fireworks.\\n\\n“There have been problems in maintaining order and dealing with huge numbers of young people who have shown up through social media at the fireworks and who have been disruptive,” said Mayor Earl Leiken to the Shaker Heights Patch.\\n\\nDerek Abbot lives near the Shaker Heights trouble. He told the Patch:\\n\\n“The last two years, the streets have been littered with trash. A ton of teenagers have been acting unruly, and I’ve heard stories of fighting in people’s yards. I think the problem is that every other community canceled their fireworks while we kept ours.”\\n\\nIn one news story at the Cleveland Plain Dealer, a reader was frustrated that the paper had not reported the riot.\\n\\n“My daughter and I will NOT be back next year. ‘Daddy why are all those kids screaming, swearing and fighting?’ ‘Because their parents didn’t raise them any better honey.’ “Nothing better to see police in riot gear riding on the outside of a SWAT van as the fireworks celebrating our freedom from the English rule rush toward a crowd of idiots, Then police officers telling people that are there to watch the fireworks that THEY have to leave. “But I thought that the police would put an end to that. I was wrong.”\\n\\nOver at the Cleveland Patch, Steve Smith had a similar experience.\\n\\n“It’s not fear-mongering to say that these people created a real, dangerous environment.”\\n\\nLinda Jenkins told the Patch: “We were patient and scared. It was so sad to see families sitting along the sidewalks trying to have a wonderful and traditional outing for most of us to be placed in the middle of madness that’s what it felt like for me.”\\n\\nThe year before, Shaker Heights had a similar experience. A few weeks after that event, a columnist for the Plain Dealer got around to writing:\\n\\n“We were watching fireworks on July 4th in Shaker Heights. The only fireworks we saw were in the sky, but in another area, kids went wild. Some 500 to 1,000 showed up in a flash mob. “Harmless fun? Not to the teen who ended up with a broken jaw.”\\n\\nOn Twitter, a black woman from Cleveland who goes by the handle @Coke216, had another perspective on Shaker Heights 2012: “Yo, I got attacked by racist cops and attack dogs yesterday, cuz n**** wanted to start a riot at the fireworks. Lol.”\\n\\nIn a story five months after the riot, David Moore told the Plain Dealer: “What was once a pleasant event has now become a pitched battle at the west end of the show. The point is that the 2012 fireworks were a disaster, and we can’t do much more to enhance security.”\\n\\nBedford and Shaker Heights were not the first cities in Ohio to cancel their fireworks because of racial violence. Just the latest. Prior to this year, Euclid and Warrensville Heights also canceled their celebrations after extended experiences with violence.\\n\\nShaker Heights had enough. This year they said no more.\\n\\nSo did the residents of the Minneapolis suburb of Richfield. Black mob violence has plagued that city’s Independence Day party since 2006, said police chief Chief Todd Sandell. According to mssun.com:\\n\\n“Police responded to significant gang activity the night of July 4 at Veterans Park, the site of the carnival.”\\n\\nAccording to the memo, nine street gangs were identified in the park, as Richfield police responded to 19 “calls for service” that included disorderly conduct, assault and weapons violations.”\\n\\nAs these and other cities canceled their fireworks and surrounding parties, other cities such as Baltimore are gearing up to prepare for the annual violence.\\n\\nThe Baltimore Inner Harbor has been the site of black mob violence during the holiday for years. State legislator Pat McDonough called on the governor last year to declare the upscale Inner Harbor a “No-Go Zone” because of black mob violence.\\n\\nThis year, the city is in the midst of a record-breaking crime wave, and the police are promising a “dramatic increase” in presence through July 4, said the Baltimore Sun.\\n\\nDitto at Fort Lauderdale: The city experienced unprecedented black mob violence at the boardwalk over the Memorial Day weekend, and now the city has “tripled the number of officers normally assigned to the beach,” said city commissioner Dean Trantalis. “Be assured: The city is ready for the Fourth of July.”\\n\\nLast year, Chris Rock began the holiday with an explosive tweet: “Happy white peoples Independence Day. The slaves weren’t free but I’m sure they enjoyed fireworks.”\\n\\nThat night, more than a dozen cities including Chicago, Los Angeles, Cleveland, Columbus, Albany (Georgia,) Waco, Peoria, Greensboro, Peoria experienced large scale black mob violence. Some of the fireworks were canceled before they were over. Some of the crowds shot fireworks at the police.\\n\\nThe July 4 violence of 2012 is documented in “White Girl Bleed a Lot: The return of racial violence and how the media ignore it.”\\n\\nSee the Big List of black mob violence.',\n",

       " ('(First published via Prosper Australia, written during Michael’s recent Oz tour.)\\n\\nConfronted by the global financial crisis that is burying foreign economies deeper in debt deflation each month, Australia needs to protect itself – indeed, to liberate itself from as many costs and risks as it can. Fortunately, many of its costs and risks are unnecessary, merely a result of the inertia of old ways of thinking.\\n\\nAustralia has the means to protect its growth and to keep more of its income at home. But if it is to remain immune to the GFC meltdown, it must escape from the risky environment of foreign financial dependency. This requires new arrangements to take account of the rapidly changing character of credit.\\n\\nForeign credit is the most obvious yet also most needless form of Australian dependency today. It is created without cost on computer keyboards in Japan, the United States and Britain and lent out at LIBOR rates as low as 1% to arbitrageurs buying Australian securities yielding at least 4.50% and rising. The 2 or 3% arbitrage gain is a free ride for speculators – at Australia’s expense.\\n\\nOver and above being a domestic expense, it must be paid in foreign exchange. This repayment will cause future pressure to drive the A$ back down, perpetuating Australia’s roller-coaster exchange rate cycle.\\n\\nThere is a widespread impression that if Australia created a similar amount of credit at home, this would be inflationary. That may be true – but it is more inflationary to allow foreigners to manufacture credit and add an interest charge that domestic credit creation could avoid.\\n\\nMore immediately, the flow of foreign credit creation into Australian securities and loans to Australian banks pushes up the exchange rate. This makes Australian labor, products and services more costly in world markets. The strong dollar already has prompted companies to warn of lower earnings and employment in the immediate future.\\n\\nAustralia requires investment for nation building. Some people believe that this investment requires saving out of current earnings. The national saving rate has indeed turned up recently, but this statistic is deceptive. It is the result of Australian banks cutting back their lending, requiring home owners to consume less and save more to pay off their loans.\\n\\nDoes this mean that Australia needs to turn to foreigners to supply “savings”?\\n\\nNot at all because foreign economies are in the same boat, paying off the enormous debts that the global real estate bubble has obliged homebuyers and others to take on in order to obtain access to housing.\\n\\nWhere then does the foreign lending come from, if not saving? The answer is hard for many people to believe, but it is new electronic “free lunch” credit creation.\\n\\nAustralia can create credit itself just as easily as foreigners. It is merely a policy choice to let foreigners perform this task and extract income from Australia with its higher interest rates.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the balance of payments makes its manufactured exports less competitive, and even eats into the earnings of its mining industry. (Mineral prices are set in U.S. dollars or other foreign currency, which yields fewer Australian dollars as the latter’s exchange rate rises.)\\n\\nNo nation need borrow in a foreign currency for spending in its domestic currency. Whether loans are created in Australia or at home, only Australia itself can create Australian money and credit.\\n\\nORDER IT NOW\\n\\nThe problem is that Australia runs a chronic current account deficit that needs to be financed with inward foreign investment if the exchange rate is to be held stable. Rather than “selling off the farm” and/or becoming indebted to foreigners, Australia should only spend as much foreign currency as it earns.\\n\\nMarket forces can achieve this result if exporters are not forced to gift the foreign currencies they earn to a national pool. Instead, exporters would obtain a second income by selling their foreign exchange to importers.\\n\\nWithout allowing market forces to keep current account transactions in balance, Australia is paying a high price for the self-imposed, old-fashioned view that it needs foreign money to invest at home. What the nation needs more than foreign credit is a more modern understanding that credit can be created without cost regardless of where it is created.\\n\\nTo avoid inflation – and to give value to this credit – the government needs to levy taxes. In view of the statement by the Reserve Bank of Australia that the reason it is raising interest rates is to slow the property bubble, a tax on land values, with which Australia (unlike the U.S.) is already familiar, would address the problem without creating a rise in the A$, without pricing its manufacturing out of foreign and domestic markets, and without giving international arbitrageurs a free lunch.\\n\\n* Michael Hudson is Distinguished Research Professor of Economics at the University of Missouri and Dr Shann Turnbull is Principal of the International Institute for Self-governance based in Sydney.',\n",

She looked up from her desk, and she talked in the hallways of the Pentagon, and there she saw the studied, bureaucratic maneuverings that allowed a small cadre of anti-republic insiders to fix intelligence to lie the US into war. She saw a crime on a global scale take shape. And she got out. (Paragraph added 3/3/06 4:41 PM)\\n\\nThere are many choice nuggets. I suggest reading them slowly -- she speaks much more plainly than we are used to.\\n\\nThe Constitution was ignored:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou know, we sort of noticed it pulled the Constitution. We have a sense that the people in the Pentagon will be very apolitical. Certainly, the political bosses reflect any administration, the administration that places them there, and that\\'s fine. But, I saw a type of politicization almost from the very first week in Near East-South Asia policy, which really violated the idea of an apolitical military. This [Pentagon Office of Near East-South Asia Affairs?] was an agenda-setting organization, and the agenda was war. The agenda was an invasion of Iraq. ... But, certainly the agenda amongst the political appointees there, almost a little nest of very ideologically motivated folks.\\n\\nWas this in response to 9/11? Only as an opportunity. The roots go much further back:\\n\\n\\n\\nthis refocusing of American foreign policy as a unilateral power, as a shaper of not just ourselves but of others, this comes about early on, 35, 40 years ago. Neo-conservatism is a big part of it.\\n\\nAnd by what plant did this un-Consitutional doctrine enter into American policy?\\n\\n\\n\\nBut, what it [PNAC\\'s 1998 position paper, \"Rebuilding America\\'s Defenses\"] calls for is very much what George Bush has more overtly called for, which is America at the top of the world, a unilateral approach and that kind of thing. Very, very similar. I think that Bill Kristol underestimates modestly the - he\\'s a very modest man, and so he is not going to give the project for New American Century too much, but you can find it in the words, and you can also find it in the members. The Project for New American Century brought many, many key leaders and key political appointees, people that were working on the Project for New American Century moved seamlessly into government, and that starts with Dick Cheney.\\n\\nSo what did Cheney and the henchmen from PNAC do? They set up special offices and hired everyone of their operatives that they could. Remember, Cheney had been in the White House cabinet before -- he and Rumsfeld and their top aides had the knowledge and now the power to do this. Mostly, they concentrated on propaganda -- the ideology and the action had already been laid out.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Office of Special Plans had one primary job, and that was to produce a set of talking points on the topic of Iraq, WMD and terrorism, and we were to use them in any document that we prepared exactly as they were written in their entirety. We were - all of us, myself included, very familiar with what the intelligence was saying about Iraq. But, the problem was, when you look at what was in these talking points, you could tell it was designed to convince the reader that Iraq and Saddam Hussein specifically constituted a major serious, terrible, evil threat to not just his neighbors but to the United States.\\n\\nDid they tell the truth. No. Did they lie? Yes. Often, at length, and with malice aforethought.\\n\\n\\n\\n[From the movie, cited in the interview.]\\n\\nHis regime has the design for a nuclear weapon, was working on several different methods of enriching uranium, and recently was discovered seeking significant quantities of uranium from Africa. [RUMSFELD] There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction. [CHENEY] The United States knows that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. The UK knows that they have weapons of mass destruction. Any country on the face of the earth with an active intelligence program knows that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. [RUMSFELD]\\n\\nWere they really lying?\\n\\n\\n\\nBut, the intelligence actually said that Saddam Hussein in the \\'80s, in the late \\'80s, actively sought fissionable materials in Africa, but he hasn\\'t done anything like that in the past 12 years. The statement, we act like he did it yesterday, taking bits of intelligence out of context without the qualifiers, without the rest of the story, and placing it as a bullet and presenting it as if it\\'s a factoid. ... These guys were manipulating public opinion, OK, creating falsehoods and fantasies to inspire fear in the American people so that they could have their war.\\n\\nThat\\'s just a sample -- there is a lot more there, all of it worth reading. Names are named and more of the means by which the NeoCon agenda was spliced live into the Pentagon are specified. She discusses the strategic importance of Iraq.\\n\\nOne of Kwiatkowski\\'s closiing quotes puts things in perspective -- a damning perspective that at least gives us some reality on which to base our actions.\\n\\n\\n\\nI think, for guys like Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, a lot of the neo-conservatives, even George W. Bush and certainly Cheney, the vision is that we are not really a republic anymore. We\\'re certainly not a limited state. We are the world\\'s most important and all-powerful state, and that we have certain rights. Yes, we have certain responsibilities, but I think the rights are what drive them. And those rights include the right to do what we want, to get what we need, to have what we want to have. I think that\\'s what it is and, you know, we\\'ve built very massive mega-bases, permanent. These are permanent military bases in Iraq. We\\'ve done that in other places, as well, in the Middle East, but certainly these - this construction project in Iraq, in fact most of the money has been for military construction of - for our use.

       " ('(Natural News) A recent study funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and NASA revealed mysterious waves, otherwise known as Rossby waves, were observed on the Sun’s atmosphere, which may provide insight on a broad range of solar phenomena such as sun spot formation, solar flare eruption, and active region formations.\\n\\n“The discovery of Rossby-like waves on the Sun could be important for the prediction of solar storms, the main drivers of space weather effects on Earth. Bad weather in space can hinder or damage satellite operations, and communication and navigation systems, as well as cause power-grid outages leading to tremendous socioeconomic losses. Estimates put the cost of space weather hazards at $10 billion per year,” said Ilia Roussev, program director in NSF’s Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences.\\n\\nScientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) define Rossby waves as large-scale planetary waves associated with jet stream trails and low- and high-pressure formations, which in turn play a significant role in local weather events on Earth. These waves develop in rotating fluids such as in the oceans and the atmosphere. The existence of Rossby-like waves should not come as a surprise because the Sun rotates, and because it is mostly made of plasma that in some ways act like a magnetized ocean, said NCAR scientist and lead author Scott McIntosh.\\n\\n“The discovery of magnetised Rossby waves on the Sun offers the tantalising possibility that we can predict space weather much further in advance. Just like predicting weather on earth the global perspective on the sun is absolutely critical. Without that there is just too much guess work involved,” said McIntosh.\\n\\nThe findings of the innovative study were published in the journal Nature Astronomy.\\n\\nHow Earth-like waves were seen on the Sun’s surface\\n\\nResearchers have previously identified the presence of Rossby waves on Earth by evaluating different satellite angles in space. Scientists had previously inferred that the Sun could host Rossby-like waves, but detecting planetary waves on the Sun’s surface proved more difficult as experts were only able to study the Sun using the viewpoint from Earth’s direction. However, researchers successfully examined the Sun’s surface using data from NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory and NASA’s Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) mission, which included two spacecraft that orbited the Sun. This trio of satellites collected data and images of the Sun’s surface between 2011 to 2014.\\n\\nThe research team used the data gathered to identify and monitor coronal bright points — small bright features scattered on the Sun’s surface — and subsequently track motions within the deeper parts of the Sun’s atmosphere. The scientists also used data from the Hovmöller diagrams, a diagnostic tool designed to emphasize the role of waves on the Earth’s atmosphere. An analysis of the combined data revealed that cohesive bands of magnetized activity propagated slowly across the solar surface. This mechanism was the same as Rossby waves found on earth, researchers said.\\n\\nThe results may have implications in the study of various solar phenomena such as the development of sunspots, their lifetimes, and the origin of the Sun’s 11-year solar cycle, researchers said. The findings may also shed light on the existence of coronal mass ejections, researchers added. McIntosh stresses the results can help the scientific community better predict the Sun’s behavior.\\n\\nStill, it is important to gain a better understanding of the waves and their patterns in order to advance science’s current predictive capacities. Doing this would require another 360-degree view of the Sun, said McIntosh. “To connect the local scale with the global scale, we need to expand our view. We need a constellation of spacecraft that circle the Sun and monitor the evolution of its global magnetic field,” McIntosh added.\\n\\nRead more news about space weather and the sun at Space.news.\\n\\nSources:\\n\\nScienceDaily.com\\n\\nWired.co.uk\\n\\nUPI.com',\n",

Now, new research shows just how flawed that particular argument is. Indeed, a worldwide conversion to organic farming could be remarkably sustainable as long as some changes to current food production and consumption habits are made at the same time.\\n\\nThere are a lot of ways that industrial agriculture has increased the availability of food, but this has come at a significant cost to our environment. For example, it has led to an oversupply of reactive nitrogen that pollutes our water and soil, losses in biodiversity, and greenhouse gas emissions. This is in addition to the effects that pesticides and herbicides have on human and animal health.\\n\\nOrganic agriculture, on the other hand, eschews the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers. With its focus on crop rotations, closed nutrient cycles, and soil fertility, it is certainly a better choice for the environment, but it tends to have lower yields, thereby requiring more land in order to produce the same amount of food.\\n\\nNow, researchers from the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, Alpen-Adria University in Austria, ETH Zurich in Switzerland and the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture have written an open-access article in Nature Communications that shows just how organic agriculture could feasibly feed the world after all.\\n\\nThey say that accomplishing this worthwhile endeavor requires just a few complementary changes in our global food system. For example, reducing the amount of arable land that is used to grow animal feed and the drop in livestock and animal-based products that goes along with it could help quite a bit as people consume less meat – something that would also have positive effects on human health.\\n\\nReducing food waste could also help make this transition a reality. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, as much as 40 percent of the food that is produced is wasted around the planet. Taking measures to try to stem this problem could go a long way toward a more efficient use of resources.\\n\\nMore than nine billion people could be fed sustainably with organic agriculture\\n\\nBy making these changes, organic agriculture could help to feed more than nine billion people in 2050 in a sustainable way, the researchers have determined. Best of all, none of these corresponding measures need to be implemented fully in order to make a difference; their partial implementation can be combined to help create a more sustainable future when it comes to feeding the world.\\n\\nThey added that past research into these matters has been too tightly focused on the yields and the impact on the environment for each unit output of a given crop and has failed to take into account other changes that could help make a difference.\\n\\nThey reached their conclusions using a mass-flow model of the planet’s food system known as an SOL-model that simulated the vital agronomic features of organic farming and allowed them to determine what impacts a conversion would have on the environment and food production. Then, they factored in the effects of the two aforementioned changes – food waste reduction and a reduction the arable land used for growing animal feed – to discover that such a transition is more viable than some believe.\\n\\nThey also say that all of the scenarios offer people the same number of calories. In fact. A 20 percent rise in the share of the organic cropping area devoted to legumes raised the protein-to-calorie ratio to double the minimum of 10 percent that the US National Academy of Sciences’ Food and Nutrition Board recommends.\\n\\nTherefore, it’s entirely possible to feed a world population of more than nine billion without increasing land use and while curbing the negative effects of modern pesticide use. The researchers concluded that “a wise combination of production and consumption measures could provide an optimal food system.” Where can we sign up?\\n\\nSources include:\\n\\nScienceDaily.com\\n\\nFoodNavigator.com',\n",

In his response, the Hillsong pastor offered homosexual marriage as an issue that is a challenge for some churches.

It\\'s challenging to stay relevant. I mean, if we go to the one big hot topic maybe for churches ... now with homosexual marriage legalized, and churches for generations, they hold a set of beliefs around what they believe the Word of God, the Bible says. All of a sudden in many circles the church can look like a pariah, because to many people it\\'s so irrelevant now … So staying relevant is a big challenge.

The word of God is infallible and so I suspect it will get a lot worse.\"\\n\\nDavis spent over five days in jail last September after she refused a court order to allow her office to issue marriage licenses because she objected to having her name on licenses that authorize marriages that she feels violate her Apostolic Christian faith.\\n\\nDavis explained that she has been asked a number of times why she hasn\\'t just quit her job or retire, but she explained that doing so would cause her to lose the platform and voice that God gave her during a time she believes Christians need to stand up for their religious freedoms.\\n\\n\"It is a battle for every freedom that we possess, for every freedom that we want to hold true and dear to our hearts,\" Davis asserted. \"Each and every person, like I have said so many times, it\\'s not if it happens but when. You will be faced with it and you have to be prayed up and ready to stand and know that God is a mighty god and He is more than able to see you through it all.\"\\n\\n\"I stand as one but we as a whole are many and we are strong,\" Davis continued. \"That\\'s what Christians need to understand — when we unite, not just in stand but in our prayer, that we do make a difference.\"\\n\\nAlthough Davis was forced spend five days in jail for acting according to her religious convictions, she said that her time in jail was the most \"peaceful\" time she had throughout the whole ordeal.\\n\\n\"I can tell you, that was probably the most peaceful time that I had spent,\" Davis explained. \"I got to study the word of God. I got to read. I got to pray. I got to sing to the top of my lungs in that jail — very peaceful time.\"\\n\\nAlthough Davis called on former Kentucky Gov.

While the Macedonian-born nun feared that such darkness was because of her own weakness, Teresa\\'s spiritual director at the time showed her that it was another way for Christ to have her share in the poverty of those suffering in Calcutta.\\n\\nTeresa shared her hopes at the time: \"If my darkness and dryness can be a light to some soul let me be the first one to do that. If my life, if my suffering, is going to help souls to be saved, then I will prefer from the creation of the world to the end of time to suffer and die.\"\\n\\nShe also apparently said that she hopes to continue \"working\" in Heaven to help bring souls to God.\\n\\n\"When I die and go home to God, I can bring more souls to God,\" she said at one point, according to the priest. \"I\\'m not going to sleep in Heaven, but I\\'m going to work harder in another form.\"\\n\\nPope Francis is set to officially canonize Teresa as a saint in the Catholic Church at a ceremony at the Vatican on Sept. 4, with celebrations set to be held in Calcutta as well, Vatican Radio reported.\\n\\nBack in December, Francis approved a second miracle attributed to Teresa, concerning the healing of a Brazilian man who had suffered a viral brain infection, which cleared the way toward canonization.',\n",

By the end of it all, 15 officers had been injured, nearly 202 people arrested, and 144 vehicles and 19 structures set on fire, according to CNN.\\n\\nCitizens lining up to protect the police on W. North Ave. pic.twitter.com/Zt7nScM7lv — Van Applegate (@VBagate) April 28, 2015\\n\\nThe CVS pharmacy, a reportedly highly relied upon asset for the area\\'s senior citizens, was in a state of ruin Tuesday when residents poured into the streets to clean up the mess caused by their neighbors, many of whom appeared to be youths based on photos and videos that captured the chaos. The violence was roundly condemned by the mayor, the police chief, and community leaders and residents — with many Baltimoreans turning out to ongoing protests with the specific intent to prevent troublemakers from disrupting the demonstrations with violence and therefore provoking police, many of whom were clad in riot gear.\\n\\nNeedless to say, the events unfolding in Baltimore have captured the nation\\'s attention. Pastor Kurz, who helped plant The Garden Church in Baltimore seven years ago, cautioned outsiders and long-distance observers from taking a simplistic approach to what he believes is an otherwise complicated situation.\\n\\nSome of Baltimore City\\'s complexity is revealed among residents of Sandtown‐Winchester/Harlem Park in West Baltimore, to be where Gray lived. Baltimore\\'s population of 620,961 people, 29 percent of whom are white and 64 percent are black, live in nine regions encompassing more than 200 neighborhoods.\\n\\nIn Gray\\'s neighborhood, residents face \"extraordinary challenges around educational attainment, housing, and addiction,\" according to statistics compiled by the Justice Policy Institute and the Prison Policy Initiative. The public policy think-tanks, both of which advocate for prison reform, report that 52 percent of the residents in Gray\\'s neighborhood that are between the ages of 16-64 are unemployed, have a median household income of $24,000 (compared to $40,803 for the entire city), and have the third-highest incarceration rate among all of Baltimore. One out of every four people is on public assistance, more than double the general city average; 34 percent do not have a high school diploma or GED; and one out of every three houses is vacant or abandoned (based on 2012 findings).\\n\\nFor the 85,000 students in baltimore that are missing meals today #BaltimoreLunch volunteers are on the ground pic.twitter.com/uiLGoElsHd — Carlene (@CMP4Justice) April 28, 2015\\n\\nAnother startling statistic came to light Tuesday, when Baltimore City Public Schools kept schools closed as a safety precaution after the previous night\\'s rioting. That decision affected nearly 85,000 students, 82.7 percent of whom are African-American, 8 percent white and 7.4 percent Hispanic/Latino. A whopping 84 percent of school children in Baltimore come from low-income households and qualify for free or reduced-meals. Activists and community members immediately sprung into action, organizing collections and distribution of food on Tuesday to make sure children\\'s needs were met.\\n\\nPastor Kurz and some of his Garden Church members were also busy on Tuesday, preparing 200 lunches as part of the community-wide effort. \"With everything going on it\\'s very likely that kids were not eating throughout the day. We just wanted to make sure that before the day was over, kids, at least the few that we could get to in our own area right there, had the opportunity to eat something,\" Kurz told CP.\\n\\nKurz, who spoke via phone with CP on Wednesday, shared what he has learned from his neighbors, congregation members, and his own observations while living in Baltimore for the past seven years. In the interview, transcribed below, the Southern Baptist pastor also reveals his prayers for his city and some advice for Christians looking on and who may not be to sure what to make of the situation. The transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.\\n\\nCP: How old is The Garden Church and what does its surrounding community look like?\\n\\nKurz: We\\'ve been here since 2008. We moved into the neighborhood ... we actually live in the neighborhood where the rioting took place. The CVS that burned, that\\'s sort of like right on the edge of our neighborhood, it kinda borders our neighborhood. So that\\'s where we\\'re at. The neighborhood itself consists of predominantly generationally impoverished communities as well as working class mostly African-American males. At the same time though, we\\'re only a few blocks from a very affluent neighborhood, the Maryland Institute of Cultural Arts (Maryland Institute College of Art) is there. So it\\'s a very mixed area to some degree, at least within the close proximity of each other.',\n",

Hamel died, continue to have good relations, the 58-year-old cleric said. \"There is a large Muslim population there, and relations are normally very good between the communities… Efforts have been made by the Christian community to be welcoming to Muslims. The Sisters even give reading lessons to Muslim kids in tower blocks.\"\\n\\nIslamic State, a Sunni terror group which operates from Iraq and Syria, is \"trying to destroy those good relations,\" Nolan said. \"They target those areas, and Fr Hamel was very aware of that.\"\\n\\nThe terror group, also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh, has been losing territory in Iraq and Syria, and some have posed that to be a reason behind increased attacks in other parts of the world.

His parishioners requested that he should lead their family and community celebrations.\"\\n\\nOn July 26, two assailants stormed Hamel\\'s church and took five people hostage, including the priest, two nuns and two parishioners. They slit Hamel\\'s throat with a knife and left three others wounded.\\n\\nThe killers were identified as 19-year-old Adel Kermiche from Northern France and Abdel-Malik Nabil Petitjean, also 19, from Eastern France. They were shot and killed by authorities as they exited the church after murdering the priest.\\n\\nThe Christian Post earlier reported that the Church of the Gambetta was found on an Islamic State hit list from 2015. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack by releasing a video purporting to show the two teenagers pledging their allegiance to the jihadists.\\n\\nAccording to The Guardian, a teenager who knew Kermiche made no secret of his desire to attack the church. \"I wasn\\'t surprised. He talked about it all the time,\" he was quoted as saying. \"He talked about Islam, the things like this he was going to do.

And he believes the Church has done very little to help.\\n\\n\"[O]verall, the Church has fundamentally failed,\" Wolf, who served two decades representing Virginia\\'s 10th congressional district and now serves as a senior fellow at the 21st Century Wilberforce Initiative, said Tuesday on the \"Washington Watch\" radio program. \"Most churches used to have a Religious Freedom Sunday where they would bring in somebody from Sudan and China. And now, they are almost all gone.\\n\\n\"Unless there is change in the hearts and minds of people, I think the fundamental failure has been the Church. Dietrich Bonhoeffer said, \\'If you don\\'t speak and you don\\'t act ...\\' I don\\'t see the Church speaking and I don\\'t see the Church acting.\"\\n\\nWhile expressing disappointment with the Church failing to raise awareness about religious freedom and persecution issues at home and abroad, Wolf added that some pastors, priests and rabbis may need to do what Martin Luther King Jr. did.\\n\\n\"I think we need some men like Martin Luther King,\" he said. \"I think we need pastors to go to jail.\\n\\n\"They may very well have to go to jail to wake up this country.\"\\n\\nFamily Research Council President Tony Perkins hosted the special Religious Freedom Day broadcast. When he asked Wolf, who authored the International Religious Freedom Act in 1993 and is the namesake of the new version of the law passed in December 2016, if he believed religious freedom in the world today is \"better protected\" than it was 50 years ago, the former congressman said he believes religious freedom around the world is at \"greater risk.\"\\n\\nThe U.S. Congress doesn\\'t have the leaders that it used to — such as Henry Hyde and Tom Lantos — who pushed for religious freedom, especially in countries that receive U.S. funding, he pointed out.\\n\\n\"We have 5.5 billion people living in repressive nations,\" Wolf stated.\\n\\nWolf mentioned how the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Squire Patton Boggs is lobbying on behalf of the Sudanese government for the U.S. government to permanently repeal severe sanctions. Sudan ranks as the 4th worst country in the world when it comes to Christian persecution.\\n\\n\"When Patton Boggs takes on an indicted war criminal, you have to wonder where we have gone,\" Wolf said.\\n\\n\"From 1980 to 1988, if any law firm in this town said they wanted to represent that Soviet Union, Reagan would have cracked down on it,\" Wolf asserted. \"[SPB] represents [Omar al-]Bashir, who is an indicted war criminal. Yet you have the most powerful law firm in the city representing him. They represent China.\"\\n\\nWolf stated that religious freedom today \"is worse off because we don\\'t have the leadership now that we really have [had].\"\\n\\nWhen asked if he thinks there is a \"change on the horizon\" given the fact that the Trump administration has vowed to protect religious freedom, Wolf declared that he is \"not encouraged\" because of the fact that religious freedom no longer seems to be an important issue for not only millennials but also the Church itself.\\n\\n\"I go on to these college campuses, Christian colleges,\" Wolf, who has 16 grandkids, said. \"These kids are really not that interested.\"\\n\\nWolf also pointed out that there is much anti-semitism on American college campuses today and called the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel a form of \"soft anti-semitism.\"\\n\\nWolf called on churches across the nation to hold Religious Freedom Sundays and to hold events in which persecuted Christians from abroad are invited to speak about the persecution they faced in their home countries.\\n\\nHe also called on churches to either visit their congressional representatives and senators or invite them out to their churches to ask what they are doing to help promote religious freedom across the globe.\\n\\nWolf pointed out that there are also domestic religious freedom issues that the U.S. needs to work on.\\n\\n\"If you are a American person and you believe that marriage is between a man and a woman and you work for a high-tech company, you are not going to go very far,\" he stated. \"We have some problems in this country as well as outside.\"',\n",

       " ('(This is a picture of the four of us, taken before we left on our voyage. That\\'s Susie in front on the left, Dorothy behind her, Clara Louise next to Dorothy, and Charlotte in front on the right.)\\n\\nThe storm had delayed us and shortened the time we could stay in Hong Kong so, regrettably, we had only a glimpse of this city whose very name evoked visions of the hidden and mysterious Orient. We stepped on shore to find the dock littered with smashed fishing boats, wrecked by the typhoon. We explored as much as possible on that day but it wasn\\'t much. I remember climbing up stone steps from the dock to the street above. I had a vague expectation of something like San Francisco\\'s Chinatown but it wasn\\'t at all like that. We had only the slightest peek at this city dramatically set above its splendid harbor--a peek that made us yearn to come here again. We had only one more day. The captain had business in Macau, the Portugese colony to the west. Any passengers who wished to, could go with him. Susie and Clara Louise accepted but Dorothy and I wanted to see at least a little more of Hong Kong. We must have walked miles along the docks in hopes of reaching the Star Ferry which would take us across the bay to Kowloon from where we\\'d have a great view of the city but we got lost and had to give up. We bought some odd and interesting food from vendors--lychee nuts and some weird but flavorful almond pasty things. We saw a really enchanting baby and I wanted to get a picture. I gestured to its mother for permission but she shook her head in a vigorous negative and covered the baby\\'s face with its blanket. [Later a friend who had lived in China told me that certain religious sects believed that a child\\'s soul would be stolen when the picture was taken.] That night the captain invited all the passenger to a farewell diner at the Hong Kong Hotel. He said he would be too busy in Manila for any social activity.\\n\\nNext morning we went out to sea and were again shocked by the sight of the stranded Japanese liner. Manila was our next--and last--port of call. It was a rainy day and Susie and I were playing records on the old Victrola in the dining salon when our silent fellow passenger, the Colonel\\'s daughter, Margaret, came in. Although we were about the same age, she had never had anything to say to us. Now she sat down and actually began a conversation. She was so glad to be almost home in Manila. She had hated Singapore, she said and when we asked why, she suddenly blurted out her story, a rather garbled one. She had been accused of shop-lifting. She didn\\'t make it clear whether or not there had been a trial or exactly what had happened afterward. The poor girl was really traumatized by the affair. We could only offer sympathy but it may have helped. She needed someone to talk to--to let off steam. Her mother had heard it all.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother day at sea and when we woke next morning, the ship had already tied up up at its dock in Manila and had begun taken on its cargo of copra. The now familiar smell was penetrating. I liked it but can only describe it as pungent. We were to have only one day here so we said a hurried good-bye to \"Mrs. Colonel\" (our private name for this reserved lady) and Margaret before going ashore to see what we could of \"the Queen of the Pacific\". The typhoon we had been through had hit it as hard as it had hit Hong Kong. There were the broken fishing boats tossed around on the piers and we were told that what had once been a small fleet of water taxis was reduced to two. Peter had told us that his ship would be here at the same time so we were not surprised when we saw his tall, lanky figure heading our way to join the expedition. It was not a satisfactory one. Hong Kong had been damp and cool so that even in a very limited time we could get an idea of the place and take a mental picture of it. Manila was damp and HOT. The humidity was like that on the Coral Sea--energy-sapping. As in the case of Sumatra, all we could say was that we had been there. Peter asked us to dinner on his ship so we told the captain where we would be and having managed to get one of the water taxis, took off for the Dutch freighter on the other side of the bay. It was cooler after the sun went down so everyone revived. We had a grand evening. The Dutch officers didn\\'t speak much English and we didn\\'t speak any Dutch but Peter had picked up quite a bit of the language and was the interpreter. We were toasted in beer and we toasted them back. We told them about San Diego where we lived and they talked about Amsterdam. When it was time to go, the Dutch captain put in a call for a water taxi. No answer. Two more calls, and still no answer. The Corneville was sailing for Los Angeles that night. The captain wouldn\\'t go without us but still.....Then someone must have said (in Dutch), \"Man the lifeboats!\" Within ten minutes we were in one and being paddled across Manila Bay, singing silly songs and laughing uproariously. Halfway there, we saw our ship under floodlights, The hold was open and orange-colored copra was being loaded. We could even smell it.\\n\\nThe voyage across the Pacific took two weeks. We often stood at the stern of the ship and watched its wake, thinking sadly that our great adventure was coming to an end. The crossing was brightened however by the excitement of radiograms. There were at least ten of them. They were all for Clara Louise and they were all from Jimmy. On what could be called a one night stand on a small Philippine island, he had lost his heart to her.\\n\\nWe landed at San Pedro, the port for Los Angeles, in mid December. The following October Clara Louise went back to Manila where Jimmy was waiting for her. They were married there and went back to his island. In 1942, when the Japanese invaded, Jimmy\\'s lumber company evacuated them and their two little boys, the younger one only a few weeks old. It was a happy and sucessful marriage.\\n\\n(A note of interest: When we left on the voyage, Susie\\'s mother had said \"They\\'re all flighty but at least Clara Louise has a steady head.\")\\n\\nI kept in touch with Peter by sending and receiving occasional cards. When I married in 1939, my new husband and I went to Washington D.C. We had to change trains in Kansas City. I wrote a note to Peter and he and Harold were there to meet us at the station. Over drinks in the bar we exchanged news (Dorothy and Clara Louise married, Susie about to be)and shared memories of our own particular, our own unforgettable cruise on the Corneville.',\n",

       " ('* UPDATE, NBC “Apologizes” (Fairly pathetic one I might add – notice what is missing from the “apology?”): The NBC crew (I believe it was Dan Hicks) just announced that “We began our coverage of this final round just about 3 hours ago, and when we did, it was our intent to begin the coverage of this U.S. Open Championship with a feature that captured the patriotism of our national championship being held in our nation’s capital for the third time – regrettably a portion of the Pledge of Allegiance that was in that feature was edited out. It was not done to upset anyone. And, we would like to apologize to those of you who were offended by it.”\\n\\n*******\\n\\nJust as I thought that the primary reason a father who loves golf as much I do would have to boycott NBC Sports and it’s recently acquired Golf Channel is the inundation of frigging Viagra (and similar) commercials, the geniuses at NBC decided to use their considerable wisdom and virtue to edit the Pledge of Allegiance for the rest of us, for they consider us dupes.\\n\\nThis morning, before the final round of the United States Open – a Father’s Day tradition for golfers in this country and beyond, and arguably the most grueling test of golf in the world – NBC produced one of those little lead-in montages… You see, the Open is being played at historic Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Maryland, right outside of Washington, DC, and the montage was a little patriotic deal showing pictures along with clips of kids reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. Only – the fine producers at NBC decided that it would be much better for the viewers not to be subjected to the phrase “under God,” not once – but twice.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis, of course, is not all that surprising – but then it happens. And we just let it happen. You see, the network is right that we are dupes, but not for the reasons they think – that is, that we are backwards, hayseed, Bible-thumpers in flyover country. Rather, we are dupes because we just keep watching and keep letting it happen. We want to watch sports, so we just gather ’round the TV for the latest erectile dysfunction commercial or teenage-targeted, sexed-up “Axe” commercial. We wait for the creative geniuses on Madison Ave. to give us another Go-Daddy clip while we bow-down to pink-clad athletes on the field promoting Susan Komen (and the money the organization gives to Planned Parenthood), all while watching the “green” broadcast from NBC where they praise each other for being planet friendly – no doubt having eschewed the limo for the Prius en route to the studio.\\n\\nJust like the countless other things we do every day endorsing, either overtly or silently, the downgrade of God, marriage and most things virtuous – we just keep on watching.\\n\\nI wish I thought there would be a “fix” beyond DVR. But then, that’s not really my point. My point is that the secular elitists continue to own it all and to push their view of the world into every aspect of our lives while we are forced to retreat to the corners of our churches and houses and pretend we are not supporting this nonsense when we watch and when we buy the products of the advertisers.\\n\\nOh – and Rory just birdied the first hole to go to minus 15… just in case you wondered how my glass house is doing…',\n",

       " (', there were more Joe Lieberman signs than Ned Lamont sings posted around the voting place (a local firestation in New Haven). That being said, there were two Lamont volunteers holding signs on the side of the fire station where more people were entering. There was no shouting, I walked in from the other side of the station so nobody tried to convince me of voting one way or the other, but there were clearly more Lieberman signs (5:1 or so).\\n\\nSecond, I was a little unhappy with the order of the names in the voting machine. It was a manual voting machine I don\\'t know the name or model, but it looked like this:\\n\\nhttp://www.newsday.com/...\\n\\nThere were only six names in the ballot, listed in the top left six levers in the following order (if I remember correctly):\\n\\n\\n\\nDan Malloy : Mary Messina Glassman : Joe Lieberman\\n\\nJohn DeStephano: Scott Slifka : Ned Lamont\\n\\n\\n\\nNot much descriptive info listed above the names (took a few seconds to make sure I was pulling the correct lever) - and I HATE the fact that my preferred candidate is listed last, although I guess that\\'s a consequence of the party convention a few months ago. It seems weird that Ms. Glassman and Mr. Slifka as candidates for Lt. Governor would be listed before Lieberman and Lamont, but that\\'s the deal.\\n\\nThird, I don\\'t know CT law particularly well, but we had to show a picture ID before they said \"you\\'re OK to vote\", although that being said the voting worker didn\\'t really look at my ID particularly well (took me a few moments to find it from my wallet). The names on the voter registration list were ordered by address, I told her my address, she said my name, I said yes, and showed her my ID. Simple as that.\\n\\nFinally, the voting machine obviously doesn\\'t provide a paper record of voting, although I have a sticker. There was no pre- or post- voting polling being done outside the station, no media, really no line at all.\\n\\nThat\\'s my experience today voting - I would hope that other people in CT would post their experiences as well',\n",

I\\'m keeping this coverage of this historic event going in order to keep the energy alive during these challenging times.\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nMy guest today is Christy Williams, long-time Texas resident.\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nJoan Brunwasser: Welcome back to OpEdNews, Christy. You participated in the Women\\'s March on the day after Inauguration Day. You had several options and chose to march in Austin. How did you decide?\\n\\nChristy Williams: Thank you, Joan.\\n\\nWhen I heard that there was going to be a march in Washington to protest the Trump presidency, I immediately wanted to go and show my support for the resistance. However, I realized in short order that I wouldn\\'t be able to go there, with flights and buses filling up, and I didn\\'t know where I could stay. It just seemed unmanageable. So, I was really happy to find out that there was going to be a march at the Texas Capitol at the same time as the Washington March. A friend of mine was going to be in Austin for work at that time, so we agreed to go to the march together. The Dallas march was not organized until about three weeks before the inauguration, and at that point, the Austin plans were set.\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nJB: So, what was it like? We\\'ve been hearing lots from places more northward. I\\'m curious how the Austin march went and how, if at all, it was different from the other ones. Tell us more!\\n\\nCW: I don\\'t think it was any different despite the fact that it is in the south or in Texas. Austin is urban and largely democratic. I have heard that there are 150 people moving to Austin every day. It is a very cosmopolitan city.\\n\\nJB: Quite true, but you simply lack the critical masses that can turn out 100,000 or more for an event of this type outside the South. How many Austinites showed up?\\n\\nCW: I\\'ve heard estimates between 40-50,000 women, men and children. It was so exhilarating and a welcome antidote to the despondency, isolation, powerlessness and disillusionment I had felt since the election when I was shocked to learn that many of my fellow Americans were either racist, misogynist, homophobic, xenophobes who were ok with torture, nuclear war and further destruction of the environment, or were people willing to overlook those qualities and policies of the man they backed for president for reasons I couldn\\'t fathom.\\n\\nJB: That sounds like a very respectable turnout. Austin is, admittedly, a blue oasis. Give us some context, please. Was this an extraordinary crowd, size-wise, for Austin? I\\'m asking because crowd sizes across the country exceeded expectations and in many cases were the largest ever seen in those cities.\\n\\nCW: Yes, it was an extraordinary crowd size. I had been to the Not My President and No DaPL [No Dakota Access PipeLine] marches in Dallas which drew very small crowds - under 500. It was amazing to be with so many people who were mobilized and energized to be heard. The Women\\'s March in Dallas which was organized very late in the game, by the time the Dallasites had already planned to go to Austin, drew 8,000 - very respectable.\\n\\nRight after we arrived, I got my picture taken at the Capitol. I am still hoping for peace on earth.

Thanks for the photo treat! It looks like everyone had a gay old time. But now the party\\'s over and we\\'re all back home. Has this changed anything about the way you live your life or are you back to \\'same old same old\\'?\\n\\nCW: Yes, it has changed my life. I am inspired to resist. It\\'s become a part-time job. I am signing petitions, writing postcards and calling my representatives, donating money, going to demonstrations, meeting with others for discussion and planning, and staying abreast of what government is doing. We have to work in whatever way we can to push forward the rights of women, targeted groups, families, animals and the planet.\\n\\nJB: I noticed that your Facebook activity has also changed. What\\'s going on there these days that\\'s different than pre-March?\\n\\nCW: I had been putting up some political posts along with the usual pictures and life events during the whole election cycle, but as the inauguration came closer, it became mostly political posts, some of them very dark. I know it\\'s an echo chamber on my Facebook page, but I think we are drawing support and information from each other.\\n\\nJB: Have you lost any Facebook friends over the volume and tenor of your posts?\\n\\nCW: I don\\'t actually know. I have unfriended one person who became verbally aggressive and I have unfollowed other people who are posting things that just get me too agitated.\\n\\nJB: I hear you! Anything you\\'d like to add before we wrap this up?\\n\\nCW: Each and every one of us needs to resist and not lose hope nor energy for this vital work. And, thanks, Joan!\\n\\nJB: Well said, Christy.

Thirty-two trillion dollars is more than twice the U.S. GDP and more than twice the national debt.\\n\\nCDS are a form of derivative taken out by investors as insurance against default. According to the Comptroller of the Currency, nearly 95% of the banking industry\\'s total exposure to derivatives contracts is held by the nation\\'s five largest banks: JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, HSBC, and Goldman Sachs. The CDS market is unregulated, and there is no requirement that the \"insurer\" actually have the funds to pay up. CDS are more like bets, and a massive loss at the casino could bring the house down.\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nIt could, at least, unless the casino is rigged. Whether a \"credit event\" is a \"default\" triggering a payout is determined by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), and it seems that the ISDA is owned by the world\\'s largest banks and hedge funds. That means the house determines whether the house has to pay.\\n\\nThe Houses of Morgan, Goldman and the other Big Five are justifiably worried right now, because an \"event of default\" declared on European sovereign debt could jeopardize their $32 trillion derivatives scheme. According to Rudy Avizius in an article on The Market Oracle (UK) on February 15th, t hat explains what happened at MF Global, and why the 50% Greek bond write-down was not declared an event of default.\\n\\nIf you paid only 50% of your mortgage every month, these same banks would quickly declare you in default. But the rules are quite different when the banks are the insurers underwriting the deal.\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nMF Global: Canary in the Coal Mine?\\n\\nMF Global was a major global financial derivatives broker until it met its unseemly demise on October 30, 2011, when it filed the eighth-largest U.S. bankruptcy after reporting a \"material shortfall\" of hundreds of millions of dollars in segregated customer funds. The brokerage used a large number of complex and controversial repurchase agreements, or \"repos,\" for funding and for leveraging profit. Among its losing bets was something described as a wrong-way $6.3 billion trade the brokerage made on its own behalf on bonds of some of Europe\\'s most indebted nations.\\n\\nAvizius writes:\\n\\n[A]n agreement was reached in Europe that investors would have to take a write-down of 50% on Greek Bond debt. Now MF Global was leveraged anywhere from 40 to 1, to 80 to 1 depending on whose figures you believe. Let\\'s assume that MF Global was leveraged 40 to 1, this means that they could not even absorb a small 3% loss, so when the \"haircut\" of 50% was agreed to, MF Global was finished. It tried to stem its losses by criminally dipping into segregated client accounts, and we all know how that ended with clients losing their money. . . . However, MF Global thought that they had risk-free speculation because they had bought these CDS from these big banks to protect themselves in case their bets on European Debt went bad. MF Global should have been protected by its CDS, but since the ISDA would not declare the Greek \"credit event\" to be a default, MF Global could not cover its losses, causing its collapse.\\n\\nThe house won because it was able to define what \" winning\" was. But what happens when Greece or another country simply walks away and refuses to pay? That is hardly a \"haircut.\" It is a decapitation. The asset is in rigor mortis. By no dictionary definition could it not qualify as a \"default.\"\\n\\nThat sort of definitive Greek default is thought by some analysts to be quite likely, and to be coming soon. Dr. Irwin Stelzer, a senior fellow and director of Hudson Institute\\'s economic policy studies group, was quoted in Saturday\\'s Yorkshire Post (UK) as saying:\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nIt\\'s only a matter of time before they go bankrupt. They are bankrupt now, it\\'s only a question of how you recognise it and what you call it. Certainly they will default . . . maybe as early as March. If I were them I\\'d get out [of the euro].\\n\\nThe Midas Touch Gone Bad\\n\\nIn an article in The Observer (UK) on February 11th titled \"The Mathematical Equation That Caused the Banks to Crash,\" Ian Stewart wrote of the Black-Scholes equation that opened up the world of derivatives:\\n\\nThe financial sector called it the Midas Formula and saw it as a recipe for making everything turn to gold. But the markets forgot how the story of King Midas ended.\\n\\nAs Aristotle told this ancient Greek tale, Midas died of hunger as a result of his vain prayer for the golden touch. Today, the Greek people are going hungry to protect a rigged $32 trillion Wall Street casino. Avizius writes:\\n\\nNext Page 1 | 2',\n",

Another speaker, a libertarian, whipped up the crowd with stories of government outrages. Government, he asserted in example after example, was the cause of most of our problems.\\n\\nI know from experience covering ethnic wars in Yugoslavia and Central Africa the impact that emotion-driven anecdotes can have in leading people to broad and often unjustified conclusions that can trigger dangerous outcomes.\\n\\nAnd in this case, some of the government excesses and outrages didn\\'t sound right to me.\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nOne in particular intrigued me.

The speaker then mentioned that he\\'d sure like to be paid huge sums to sit around and ogle bathing beauties - -a line that got big laughs.\\n\\nBut how true is this? And if true, how representative?\\n\\nIf you do a search on \"lifeguard pensions,\" you get a bunch of articles from the new \"conservative media\" that are becoming powerful players on the Internet.

(Image)\\n\\n\"A consortium of 18 heavyweight investors is calling for Mr Murdoch to stand down as chairman in the interests of good corporate governance and be replaced by an independent figure who is seen to be acting in the best interests of shareholders.\" The Independent, July 20\\n\\nThe investors have filed a resolution to remove Murdoch from power at the October News Corp shareholders meeting. The resolution will accompany those already filed by large investors in the United States.\\n\\nWhat upsets the 18? Murdoch and his family have too much control. That control serves the family well, but not the shareholders. Specifically, recent scandals have hurt News Corp performance.\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\n\"The resolution is the latest in a series of attempts by some independent investors in News Corp to wrest power from the Murdoch family. But following the turbulent recent history of the company, in which its share price has been damaged by the phone-hacking scandal and it has failed in an attempt to take full control of BSkyB, the new resolution is thought to have a stronger chance of success than previous actions.\" The Independent, July 20\\n\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s cut to the end of Murdoch\\'s struggle to hang onto his empire. When News Corporation announced a reorganization splitting the company into two separate entities, the Wall Street Journal did a nice summary of profitability for the new entities. The future for high growth revenues at News Corporation is in cable TV. The bulk of cable growth comes from the 39% share Murdoch owns of the UK satellite/cable operation, BSkyB.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nThe Sky is Falling\\n\\n\\n\\nThe phone hacking and other scandals prevented Murdoch from acquiring the remaining 61% of BSkyB, a move that was almost assured before criminal and immoral behavior at News Corp newspapers caught fire with the public starting on July 4, 2011.\\n\\nThe phone hacking and other scandals may very well result in Murdoch losing the existing 39% if UK regulators determine that Murdoch is not a \"fit and proper person\" to own a major media company.\\n\\nIn 2011, News Corp newspapers, movies, and broadcast television had relatively modest profits on multibillion dollar revenue streams. Movies fluctuate based on the popularity of titles released. Newspapers and broadcast television are treading water but face diminished popularity and eventual replacement over time.\\n\\nCable TV operations are the lone high growth operations with a 35% profit on $8.8 billion in revenue. News Corp\\'s 39% of BSkyB contributes more than half of the 2011 cable profits.\\n\\nAnd Murdoch\\'s illegal and immoral behavior related to phone hacking already cost the company total BSkyB ownership. His behavior and that of his family may cost the company the remaining 39%.\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nThe shareholders have enough to topple Murdoch even if he retains 39% of the British cable operation. If he\\'s tossed out of the UK cable business, the financial gem of the empire, rebellious shareholders should prevail without any doubt.\\n\\nMurdoch is supposed to be a master of the universe, a media genius, the irresistible force that can move any object. In fact, he\\'s a poor strategist, unable to recognize the goose laying the golden eggs, and unwilling to curb his ego and an appetite for money that he doesn\\'t need.\\n\\nMurdoch had one high growth operation, BSkyB, with a virtual monopoly in the UK. As David Wolf pointed out, Murdoch preferred to obsess on his news operations. He couldn\\'t even manage those properties. That abject failure may cost him everything.

The dominant media narrative seems to be that it was Russian intervention that created the problem of Crimean separatism in the first place, so, if Russian troops are removed, everything will soon return to normal.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is wishful thinking. In fact, as research done by University of Ottawa professor Ivan Katchanovski shows, resentment against the central government in Kiev has been on the rise in Crimea since the 2004 Orange revolution. If, in 1996 and 2001, only half of Crimean residents supported rejoining Russia, by 2008 a survey by the Kiev-based Razumkov Center showed that, among those who had made up their mind on the issue, 73 percent backed secession from Ukraine with a goal of joining Russia. When given additional options, 47 percent said they favored Crimea becoming an independent state, while 6 percent wanted to join Turkey.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is especially interesting to note that in that survey 65 percent of ethnic Ukrainians said they too wished to join Russia. Only Crimean Tatars, about 12 percent of the population, were predominantly against joining Russia, preferring their own national autonomy within Ukraine. It is therefore no surprise that in the latest poll, taken by the Crimean Republic's Institute for Political and Sociological Research, 85 percent say they plan to take part in the referendum, and 77 percent say they will vote to join the Russian Federation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n- Advertisement -\",\n",

I get up every day at 5 AM, pour a cup of coffee and turn on MSNBC while I work at my computer. 3 days ago I did and heard no sound. Getting up to check out the TV to see if the cable was still working I read a message on the screen. On Comcast Cable Channel 56 in Wilmington, DE. It said, \"This channel is now available with a CableCard or Digital Cable Box from Comcast. Call 1-800-COMCAST for more information. This change is separate from the federally mandated broadcast digital transition (DTV) scheduled for June 12, 2009.\" Immediately I switched to Channel 65, The Fox Network. It was still there with no such message. WTF? Is this change politically motivated? I began my research into Comcast and their founders. I discovered some interesting information.\\n\\nBrian L. Roberts is the CEO of Comcast. After reading his history and acquisition of power within the company I was quite impressed by the fact that he earned his way to the top. His father Ralph Roberts was quite insistent that he start from the ground up. Over the course of Comcast\\'s history, Brian L. Roberts made some very risky yet profitable decisions that led his company to the top of their industry with over 20.3 billion dollars in revenue in 2004.\\n\\nComcast states in their Cable TV agreement that they reserve the right to make channel changes at their discretion. Discretion? Is this based on business, religion or political affiliation? I hereby challenge Mr. Roberts to make a statement to the subscribers as to his true motivations. Why should anyone who watches a program regularly have to be subjected to his whims? Especially when the liberally biased station can only be viewed by paying an additional monthly fee to Comcast while the conservatively biased station remains free to basic cable subscribers. Are you a Republican or Mormon Mr. Roberts? Are your whims to change channels to a pay status based on your political or religious views? Please let us all know before we have to shell out an additional $10 a month to your monolithic company.\\n\\nAlso, let\\'s talk about public, educational and government access as well as leased access. The government has mandated that your company provide these services to your subscriber base, yet you are downsizing your staff and production facilities to meet the demands of your bean counters. Many people blame lawyers for our current problems but I submit to you that it is the bean counters. Pinch here, cut there and downsize everywhere. Yet corporate CEO\\'s walk away with millions of dollars for their hard \"work\", if you can call it that. Making financial strides and benefitting enormously from those strides personally while you pay your starting workers $14.00/hour without sufficient medical coverage is not very Judeo-Christian-like, Mr. Roberts. You have built your empire off of the backs of worker bees that get up every morning and come to work for your company and squeak through their bills and debts on the meager income you offer them. And then, you arbitrarily deny them the truth about what is going on in the world on MSNBC unless they pay you an additional $10 a month!\\n\\n- Advertisement -',\n",

       " ('- Advertisement -\\n\\nMy guest today is award-winning syndicated journalist and author, Robert C. Koehler. Welcome back to OpEdNews, Bob.\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nJB: You wrote a piece recently called succinctly, Abolishing the CIA . Isn\\'t that a bit of an overreaction or hyperbole?\\n\\nBK: I didn\\'t mean it as hyperbole and I don\\'t think it\\'s an overreaction. Rather, it\\'s a rational and sensible reaction, I think, not just to the latest torture report but to all the harm the agency has done over the years. The main point of my column was that everything the agency stands for is antithetical to the national interest. Sen. Daniel Moynihan introduced legislation to abolish the CIA both in 1991 and again in 1995. That was my inspiration for the column. The agency was obsolete and counterproductive then; twenty years later, it\\'s even more so. I\\'m committed to the idea that the nations, or rather, the peoples of the world have to learn how to create real peace on the planet. Abolishing the CIA strikes me as an excellent starting point for this enormous effort.\\n\\nJB: It\\'s hard for me to even imagine a world without the CIA, however sad that might be. Maybe we could spend a little time elaborating on how harmful it is. Let\\'s start with the torture report. Wasn\\'t the CIA just doing its job to keep American citizens safe?\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nBK: The U.S. launched its disastrous war on Iraq based largely on the false intelligence the CIA produced via torture.This intelligence was, of course, what the neocon cabal, which had a pre-9/11 interest in invading Iraq, wanted. So yes, the CIA was just doing its job, but its job wasn\\'t, and isn\\'t, to keep American citizens safe.The torture techniques detailed in the report are horrific to read about. They include beatings and waterboarding and something called \"rectal rehydration.\" They include sleep deprivation, hideous stress (one detainee was chained to the wall in a standing position for 17 days.) They include threats to harm or murder the detainees\\' children or wife or mother. As I say, the Senate Intelligence Committee report makes clear that the information extracted by these techniques had no accuracy, belying all justification of them. But more to the point, torture and murder are utterly immoral acts, which rouse fury and hatred that come back to haunt the perpetrators: the American people.\\n\\nJB: Has the CIA at least been on the up and up regarding their role in all this? I know that Dick Cheney is still out there swinging. Haven\\'t top honchos at the CIA spoken before Congress on numerous occasions, giving sworn testimony? Or am I misremembering? What are we to believe?\\n\\nBK: I think mostly the honchos have denied the use of torture or else, if outright denial was impossible, they dodged the bullet and said whatever was done was necessary. That\\'s Cheney\\'s mantra.\\n\\nJB: So, where does it leave us if we can\\'t trust those who are supposedly guarding our nation and its inhabitants? And how does all this fit in with all the NSA domestic surveillance or are they totally separate issues?\\n\\nBK: It leaves us where we\\'ve been for at least the last 60 or 70 years, with a growing, powerful, self-perpetuating military-industrial complex, which has no interest in being governed or regulated. It leaves us with the Washington Consensus, which is perpetual war. It leaves us with a government of secrets, secrets, secrets. The NSA is another part of the beast, growing without restraint, engorging endless data on a global scale for God only knows what purpose, if any. An abhorrence of secrecy was Sen. Moynihan\\'s motivation to introduce legislation to abolish the CIA. In a speech to the Senate, he said, \"Secrecy is a disease. It causes hardening of the arteries of the mind.\"\\n\\nJB: Sen. Moynihan\\'s mighty fine quote would be a great place to end this interview; it captures the situation perfectly. But I simply can\\'t. I like to end on an up note, whenever possible. What can we concerned citizens do against the behemoth that rules our lives? Or are we totally out of our depth here? I\\'m assuming things will only worsen after the new Congress is sworn in. Do you have anything hopeful at all to offer our readers?\\n\\n- Advertisement -\\n\\nBK: Part of the hope I feel is that a movement to abolish the CIA would bring much of the useless horror of its activities, including its past involvement in the overthrow of democratically elected governments (Iran, Guatemala, Chile), into the public debate. I also think there is a growing peace movement across the planet. One aspect of this movement is called restorative justice -- and we\\'ve talked about this , Joan. It\\'s based on healing rather than punishment, connection rather than domination. It operates at a local rather than an international level, but by and large hope has to be sought and found at the local level. If we can find real hope there, if we can see change happening there, then we can stay geared up for the long uphill struggle for global peace.\\n\\nJB: Long uphill struggle, indeed. Thanks so much for talking with me again, Bob. Let\\'s do it again soon. It\\'s always a pleasure.\\n\\n***',\n",

Painful because both would have realized their lives could have little meaning if the end goal was to enjoy the fruits of their individual freedom in the North while so many remained enslaved. Quite possibly, both Sojourner and Harriet experienced anger, too. Looking back, seeing before them the faces of family members, other families, men, women, and children subjected to the myth of Southern Chivalry, a very real national embrace of white supremacy, violence at its rawest, neither women opted to shudder of fear. Neither women could shrug off their anger, nod in acceptance of the status quo, and cheer their own good fortune. Neither Sojourner or Harriet succumbed to the distraction of distorted dreams in which \"exceptionalism\" mask the sacrificial mechanisms of an un-free and un-democratic society.\\n\\nI got mine.

       " ('...and reality bites.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf we want to remove earmarks and \"pet project funding\" then we need to fund responsibly. That means education funding must include enough money to cover capital expenditures for new computers, books as well as buildings and building renovations. We need to budget for more than road repair. We need to fund road renovations and bridge replacements.\\n\\nWhat we have is an attitude disguised as IMHO. Are all these earmarks budget bloat? ...or are they a way to get around the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)? Should we care about Dilrabo Djurakulova of Uzbekistan? He\\'s learning about how democracy works (and agreeing to disagree) here in the US thanks to earmark spending.\\n\\nBarack Obama\\'s stance on earmarks (on his Senate page) is:\\n\\nThe Transparency and Integrity in Earmarks Act Hidden, last-minute earmarks hide pork and add to wasteful federal spending. Senator Obama sponsored the Transparency and Integrity in Earmarks Act. The bill would shed light on the almost 16,000 earmarks that were included in spending bills in 2005. Under the bill, all earmarks, including the name of the requestor and a justification for the earmark, would have to be disclosed 72 hours before they could be considered by the full Senate. Senators would be prohibited from advocating for an earmark if they have a financial interest in the project or earmark recipient. And, earmark recipients would have to disclose to an Office of Public Integrity the amount that they have spent on registered lobbyists and the names of those lobbyists. Several of these provisions were included in the ethics and lobbying reform bill that passed the Senate in January 2007.\\n\\nToo bad that didn\\'t get any traction, but Obama isn\\'t done yet. Obama isn\\'t against all earmark spending, he\\'s against hidden earmark spending. There\\'s a difference. It\\'s one thing to say, Hey, I want to put $100,000 million in this bill to shore up NOLA\\'s levees and another to slip in $27 million at the last minute for a bridge that ....well, you get the point, but I\\'m going to hammer it home. It\\'s one thing to spend millions on a project that affects a million or so residents and a quite few million more annual visitors and another to spend millions on a project that helps a few thousand residents and thousands of visitors.\\n\\nThe absence of earmarks exposes the OMB (Office of Management and Budget) at its most arbitrary. Congress can pass a funding initiative, but the OMB can taketh away. Here\\'s a list of earmarks from an organization that looks into earmark spending. On the surface, these are not all bad. I don\\'t mind spending $200k getting new equipment for a Nursing school (except the School is Associated with the Assembly of God church and all that implies). I think $150k for coordinating child family services just might keep a single parent or two in school and this school is a State University. $2million for an Aviation Responsive Maintenance System needs more explanation - If the goal is to maintain a system that keeps planes from running into mountains, then I\\'m for it; but I\\'m not in favor of a \"maintenance system\" that primarily funds the salaries of the company\\'s top managment team.\\n\\nIt\\'s a mistake to label all of these earmarks as pet projects and ignore that occasional occurrance when pork and earmark spending happens because of regular budget shortfalls or political tampering with a Congressional Directive. Sometimes the Omnibus spending bill for roads, that\\'s supposed to fund bridge repairs all over the US, doesn\\'t get the job done. Earmarks address those shortfalls. Sometimes I have to trust a Congressional Critter to do their job. As long as there\\'s transparency and an ability to have meaningful rational discussion of the merits of each earmark, I\\'m ok with earmark spending.\\n\\nFor those who would like all earmarks to go away:\\n\\nWe have choices. We need to fund realisticly, fund transparently and deal with the reality that there will always be more projects than tax payer money, but earmarks are a reality that goes back to Jeffersonian days. Earmarks are here to stay, it\\'s all about controlling the spending.',\n",

It certainly calmed down the megamedia, which – after years of publishing and broadcasting stuff about Iraq quaffed from the Kool-Aid fire hose – had actually started doing the job they should have started in January 2002 when the White House initiated its march-to-war publicity tour. After years of fawning and phony patriotism in the aftermath of September 11, the megamedia finally began to make visible some ugly truths that had previously been confined to the world of the bloggerati.\\n\\nThen came the \"surge,\" the escalation designed to undermine the lukewarm recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. Within a couple of months, the coverage, except for the McClatchy people (and a few others whom you can call journalists without meaning the word as an epithet) were right back where Editor and Publisher Editor Greg Mitchell wrote about in So Wrong for So Long: How the Press, the Pundits--and the President--Failed on Iraq.\\n\\nAs I noted two weeks ago in Megamedia Coverage on Iraq Fuels Ignorance, one measure of how lousy coverage of the war affected Americans was the plunge in those who knew how many of their fellow Americans had died because of the Iraq invasion and occupation. In August 2007, 54% could correctly put the number of deaths at 3500. By the first of this month, only 28% could say the number had reached 4000. The graph shows you what’s been happening. Of course, the U.S. media have never done a good job of covering the Iraqi fatalities and other horrors of that continuing disaster.\\n\\nAs clammyc points out today in his Diary, Iraq is imploding right before our eyes, the surge isn’t working. It never was.\\n\\nCNN senior military analyst Air Force Maj. Gen. Donald Sheppard, says: \"This is intra-Shia. This is not Sunni vs. Shia, this is not civil war, this is not sectarian violence, it\\'s intra-Shia politics for control of the government.\" Yep, all those previous problems have been resolved, this is something new and it’s being dealt with. Uh-huh.\\n\\nOf course, intra-Shi’ite violence is occurring. But something new? Do the names Abdel-Aziz al-Hakim and Muqtada al-Sadr not ring any bells? Moreover, it’s not just a clash in Basra, as if the situation in Basra weren\\'t bad enough.\\n\\nFrom the BBC – Baghdad under curfew amid clashes:\\n\\nA curfew has been imposed on Baghdad amid continuing clashes between Shia militias and Iraqi security forces.\\n\\nFrom The Guardian - Mass grave found in Iraq\\n\\nAmerican and Iraqi troops today unearthed 37 bodies in a mass grave north-east of Baghdad, the US military said. The corpses were discovered near Muqdadiyah, an area that has seen frequent fighting between US troops and Sunni insurgents in the volatile Diyala province.\\n\\nFrom Der Spiegel – Americans Caught in Crossfire between Radicals and Iraqi Government:\\n\\nWith its swimming pools, manicured gardens and friendly Iraqis, Baghdad\\'s Green Zone was long seen as a luxurious, high-security enclave for Americans and their friends in a country rocked by violence. Now the oasis of security is under siege. The attacks on the \"IZ,\" or \"International Zone,\" as the US military has dubbed the former Karkh neighborhood, represent one of the biggest challenges to the American forces in Iraq to date. The enclave covers less than seven square kilometers (2.7 square miles) and houses the headquarters of the US armed forces and their allies. Until the beginning of the week, the enclave was considered the safest place in a country plagued by violence and terror.\\n\\nFrom The New York Times: Thousands in Baghdad Protest Basra Assault\\n\\nThe United States ordered embassy personnel to stay in reinforced structures because of incoming fire that killed an American on Thursday, the second U.S. fatality this week in the heavily fortified Green Zone.\\n\\nMeanwhile, says McClatchy, the President makes a speech. Bush: \\'Normalcy is returning to Iraq\\'.\\n\\nSen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in a CNN appearance Sunday that there\\'s been \"foot-dragging\" by Iraqi leaders on key political disputes. What\\'s needed, Wyden said, is to get troops out of Iraq. \"It seems to me you put off those troop withdrawals, you send exactly the wrong message to the Iraqis,\" he said. ... \"When it takes time for Iraqis to reach agreement, it is not \\'foot-dragging,\\' as one senator described it,\" Bush said. \"They\\'re striving to build a modern democracy on the rubble of three decades of tyranny.\" He noted that the U.S. Congress itself has been on a \"two-week Easter recess.\" Bush gave a litany of economic and political developments in Iraq, such as falling inflation and the approval this month of a provincial powers law, that he said showed that the \"surge\" of 30,000 U.S. troops into Iraq last year has met its goal. That goal was to improve security so that Iraqi leaders could begin political reconciliation. \"The surge has opened the door to ... strategic victory,\" Bush declared.\\n\\nAh yes, stay the course. 4004 dead American military personnel as a consequence of an invasion and occupation based on lies. If you don\\'t count the suicides. 4313 dead \"coalition\" fighters altogether. Hundreds of thousands, perhaps a million or more dead Iraqis.\\n\\nNormalcy in Iraq.',\n",

If former Assemblyman Randy Graf, a hard-right conservative, takes the normination, this ought to be a sure win. However, if one of the two moderates running can manage to get the nomination, this one will be hard faught to the end2. C0-07Beauprez is running for governor, and his hand picked succesor is Rick O'Donnell. He ought to be on the stump towards the end of the race, trying to whip up support for O'donnell. However, Ed Perlmutter is an excellent candidate who fits this lean-kerry district well.3. CT - 022002 opponent Joe Courtney is in for a rematch. Rob Simmons has toed the moderate line often, yet is the most conservative of the 3 Republican CT members of the house. He won this district in 2000 over Sam Gedjenson in a fluke, and Courtney will take him out this november. However, the Rell blowout will hurt us here, and in CT - 05 and CT - 044. IN- 09Former Rep. Baron Hill is back for a rematch with trucking exec and now Rep. Mike Sodorel. Without Bush's coattails, Baron may be able to pull off a victory. However, Lugar's lack of an opponent may hurt us in this race.5. IA- 01Nussle is running for governor, and this district ought to revert back to the democrat, Bruce Braley. Hopefully, we will see a lot of split governor/congressional tickets in this district, with people not voting for Nussle's succesor.6. IN - 08John Hostetler has never gotten above 55% in any re-election bid in this high 50's Bush district. The bloody eight will be tight again this year, with Sheriff Brad Ellsworth running, Hostetlers strongest opponent to date. He looked good in the tornedo storm earlier this year, so this will be a race that is currently a toss up.7. NM - 01Heather Wilson has always been on the edge of defeat in this 50-50 district. She faces an extremely strong contender in AG Patricia Madrid. A victory for Madrid would help us in 2008 when Domenici retires, as Wilson would be his successor with a good showing.8. PA - 06Lois Murphy is running again against Jim Gerlach, but one must wonder if the coattails of John Kerry in this suburban, soccer mom area, could possibly be any higher. However, it was a squeaker last time, and the added attention of the DCCC could bring this one into the bag.The next due are only due to scandal9. OH - 18Bob Ney is in huge trouble, but solely because of his ethical lapses. Normally, there is no way this district would be in play like it is now. However, Democrats Zack Space or Joe Sultzer look primed to take this seat due to scandal. Sultzer was a class - a recruit, however a recent article, i dont recall where, cast some doubt on his own ethics. However, he seems to fit the district from an ideological standpoint than Space, the Dover Law Director.10. TX 28We will see tonight if Tom Campbell can force a primary run-off with Delay. If he doesn't, our chances in this district remain high, with former Rep. Nick Lampson challenging the former House Majority Leader.11. FL - 22Clay Shaw is being horrible outraised by State Sen Minority Leader Ron Klein in this toss up district. Shaw only barely survived in 2002, and look for this race to come down to the wire.12. KY - 04Ken Lucas is back for a comeback, but dont overestimate the ease of this race. This is very conservative territory, and Lucas only barely dispatched Davis in 2002. However, at this moment i would put my money on Lucas for a succesful comeback.13. NC - 11Charles Taylor is in some ethical problems, and the celebrity status of Heath Shuler as a succesful college QB at Tennessee has allowed him a huge COH advantage versus Taylor. This race in the foothills of NC will be tight.14. CT - 04Diane Farrell is back for a rematch, and like the other CT districts, the Rell blowout over her dem opponent may be hard to overcome. However, Farrell came mighty close last time around, and this blue district is vulnerable for a takeover.15. CT - 05State Senator Murphy now has the primary field to himself, and looks to take out Rep. Nancy Johnson in the fall. While getting less focus that the other CT races, this may be the one that is easiest to take, as our candidate in this race seems to have more experience than the others.16. MN - 06El Tinkleberg is looking to take this open seat, being vacated by Mark Kennedy. While Wetterling did run a strong race in 2004 in this district, I would think that she has maxed out in terms of her support. Tinkleberg is a stronger candidate, and I think he can take this district17. WI - 08Dr. Steve Kagan has pumped over 1 m dollars into this race, which also has Nancy Nuessenbaum running. The GOP opponnent will be the Speaker(?) of the WI House, Bard. This is a lean R district, but another one we can take.\\n\\nAnd now the Tier 2 Races\\n\\n18. IN - 02\\n\\nSame problems with turnout here with Lugar at the top of the ticket in Chris Chocola's district. Joe Donnelly is the nominee for us, and this will be a rematch. A possible pickup.\\n\\n19. CA - 50\\n\\nThe special election is coming up. This is a solid R district, and Busby may be too liberal for the district. However, a shattered R primary field and the bad taste of Duke in the residents' mouth may bring her to victory\\n\\n20.

PA - 08\\n\\nPatrick Murphy has been getting a lot of free pub lately, and while this is harder than PA - 06, it remains a solid pickup op.\\n\\n22. KY - 02\\n\\nConservative Dem Mike Weaver is running versus Ron Lewis, and will give him the fight of his political life.\\n\\n23. OH - 01\\n\\nJim Cranley is a very strong candidate, has done well fundraising and is looking towards Chabot in November. As a political novice, he got 46% in 2002. Since he was elected to the Cincy City council and looks to be a strong pickup opp this fall.\\n\\n24. VA - 02\\n\\nThelma Drake is neither here nor there, not terribly popular or unpopular. However, Phil Kellam is a very strong candidate and could take this district into a tossup.\\n\\n25. IL -06\\n\\nI am not as optimistic about this district as many others are. Cegelis has the same problem here that Wetterling has in Minnesota. Duckworth is definately the stronger candidate, however in this R district I am pessimistic about State Sen. Peter Roskams chances of losing this open seat, vacated by Henry Hyde.\\n\\n26. CA - 11\\n\\nRichard Pombo is very conservative for this district, and Steve Filson is a solid recruit. This one will be competitive.\\n\\nThird Tier. These races lean R at the moment, but could become toss ups later\\n\\n27. PA - 07\\n\\nLentz left the primary fight to run for the State House, leaving Vice Admiral Sestak as the only challenger to Curt Weldon. This is a strong D district, but Weldon has held it for a while. However, a strong race by Sestak could bring this into our column.\\n\\n28. CO - 04\\n\\nMusgrave is vulnerable, and Angie Paccionne is challenging. This could get competitive\\n\\n29. KY - 03\\n\\nNorthup is in a democratic district, but Andrew Horne is just an okay candidate. Emmanuel failed to get a big name candidate into this race\\n\\n30. NH - 02\\n\\nBass is popular here, but Paul Hodes may be able to make a race of it.\\n\\n31. NY - 29\\n\\nFrequent poster Eric Massa, if he gets his fundraising up, could give Kuhl a run for his money\\n\\n32. NC - 08\\n\\nTim Dunn has not fundraised well, and Robin Hayes is vulnerable for his CAFTA flip-flop in this textile territory\\n\\n33.

Definate possibility though for a toss up later in the year.\\n\\nI didnt detail the long shots, only really the seats that in a Dem year have the realistic possibility of switching sides. So in a total tital wave, we would gain all these seats, yet that is unlikely.\\n\\nOn a side note, I heard we got a prime challenger to Jeb Bradley in NH - 01 that would make it a first tier race.

It was surrounded by junk and stank of pee and feces. The dogs barked incessantly, but the city did not respond to complaints filed by neighbors.\\n\\n2. According to the Olympic Animal Sanctuary website, it was a facility for unadoptable dogs. The President, Steve Markwell, claimed that his sanctuary provided the dogs with home cooked meals, safe play groups for exercise, veterinary care, and training to address behavior issues.

In spite of the fact that he had no training or credentials, Markwell claimed to be an expert in dog behavior and had been given laudatory write-ups in American Dog Magazine and the LA Times.

His tax filings showed no salary, yet he somehow paid routine living expenses. He even purchased a truck with no visible source of income other than donations. It is donor fraud to collect money for one purpose but use it for another.\\n\\n4. The OAS Board of Directors included two members who lived out of state: Markwell’s mother and a personal friend.\\n\\n5. But most damning were the photographs taken by the police. The dark filthy warehouse was crammed with dogs stacked up in crates, shoved in crates under the stairs, jammed into crates surrounded by trash. A few of the dogs had small kennels with bedding of urine-saturated straw. Classic hoarder conditions, easily recognizable to anyone who has ever seen police photos of a cruelty bust. Those pictures, obtained through the Public Records Act, were posted on Facebook along with police reports, emails from Markwell admitting to conditions in violation of state law, a copy of the citation given him for violating state law concerning cruelty to animals, emails between city officials exposing their fumbling responses to the police report and intimidation from Markwell’s lawyer, and an email from OAS Vice President Matthew Randazzo to the Mayor of Forks in which Randazzo implied that he would end future cooperation on public policy unless the prosecution was quashed. (Randazzo was Chair of the Clallam Co. Democrats and has gone on to be an aide for the state Lands Commissioner).\\n\\n6. Googling amateur investigative reporters discovered that Markwell had ingratiated himself with the Clallam County Democratic party. He had been a precinct captain, as was the City Attorney. The VP of OAS was Chair of the Clallam Co Democrats. Markwell had appeared at political events with local Democrats including Derek Kilmer (who has since repudiated Markwell). Those connections seem to have been helpful; the City Attorney decided not to prosecute.\\n\\nSo that’s what the outcry against OAS was based on: Primary resource evidence of cruelty to animals, donor fraud, tax code violations, emails revealing poor decision-making and unethical conduct by local officials. All of it public information available to the news media and to pubic officials.\\n\\nAs the city’s failure to enforce the law and the plight of the dogs was shared, the readership for the Inside page grew, eventually reaching over 12,000 “likes”, and readers from all over the US besieged the City of Forks with phone calls, letters and emails demanding the rescue of the dogs incarcerated in the sanctuary. A second Facebook page, \"Protest OAS\" became a tool for organizing anti-OAS demonstrations. Consumer fraud complaints were lodged with the state Attorney General. Lawsuits were filed. The Governor’s phone began to ring and didn’t stop for months.\\n\\nMost dog rescues, city shelters and Humane Societies have FB pages which are used to publicize adoptable dogs, raise funds and recruit volunteers. Dog rescuers check their news feeds for dogs in need or to see the responses to their own postings. Rescuers who had sent dogs to OAS were horrified when the police photos of OAS showed up on their feeds. Many of the individuals and organizations that had placed dogs with OAS requested the return of their animals and joined the effort to shut OAS down.\\n\\nPressure grew. Markwell lost his temper and filed a restraining order against two protesters. He attacked the car of another protester and was arrested. He was sued for the return of one dog and lost. City officials continued to present themselves as the victims of a Facebook mob while the real victims suffered in the warehouse. The number of dogs dropped mysteriously.\\n\\nThen suddenly, in late December of 2013, undercover of darkness, Markwell loaded the dogs into a semi truck (probably purchased with donor money) and drove away. The following days were a nightmare for those concerned about the welfare of the dogs. Hours were spent on Facebook, sharing hopes, fears, rumors of sightings of the truck and endless speculations about Markwell’s destination. Then, suddenly, the Guardians of Rescue, a New York-based group, announced that Markwell had agreed to turn the dogs over to them. On Christmas Day Markwell’s truck arrived in Golden Valley, Arizona, with 124 dogs of the 160 dogs.\\n\\nThe fate of the missing dogs is not known. After Markwell signed the surviving dogs into their custody, the Guardians had the enormous job of creating out of nothing a kennel for the dogs in the desert. As the dogs were unloaded from the truck and moved to kennels they were photographed and the pictures published on the Inside page and the Guardians’ page. All across America people anxiously examined the photos, looking for dogs they had seen in the police photos, or dogs they had sent to OAS and were hoping to retrieve. The OASIS Dogs page was established to identify survivors, memorialize the dead, and provide support for the Guardians.\\n\\nMost of the dogs had health problems resulting from their confinement at OAS. The problems included worn down teeth, malnutrition, untreated illnesses and wounds. Two dogs were near death and had to be rushed to a veterinary clinic for treatment for pressure sores, starvation, and dehydration. The Guardians spent over sixty thousand dollars on the rescue, and funds were raised through Facebook.\\n\\nOver the next four months, the Guardians of Rescue cared for the dogs while searching nationwide for safe placements for them. Again Facebook played a role. The Guardians’ Facebook page, the OASIS Dogs page and the OAS Inside the Sanctuary pages were used to spread word of the dogs to rescues coast to coast. Dogs were transferred from the Arizona site to Vermont, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Oklahoma and California. Eleven dogs made their way back to Washington State. The page “The 124: New Lives From Old” was created to celebrate successful placements and adoptions.\\n\\nAs of April, 2014, twenty-five dogs remain in Arizona, awaiting placement in a responsible rescue or sanctuary. The dogs can be seen at this website: http://www.oasisdogs.org/\\n\\nThe rescue of the OAS dogs was started by one whistleblower who posted photos on Facebook. It became a nationwide effort by ordinary people to do what local officials had refused to do: rescue dogs from a sham sanctuary. The mainstream media, with the exception of KOMO TV News, ignored the story, leaving it to the amateurs on FB to investigate and disseminate primary resource material and documentation. This remarkable rescue story was made possible because social media gave ordinary people the means to pool their skills, communicate with each other, and carry out a sustained crusade in the vacuum created by inept and unethical local officials and a disinterested press.\\n\\nDocumentation:\\n\\n1.

       " ('135 SHARES Facebook Twitter Reddit Stumbleupon Pinterest\\n\\nTwo boys in a southern West Virginia town are accused of waging a two-year campaign of sexual assault against several of their female classmates. If it were possible to get worse than that, state attorney general Patrick Morrisey has obtained evidence that suggests school administrators not only covered up the abuse, but actually retaliated against two of the girls who complained. Early Friday morning, Morrisey won an injunction against the administrators, the superintendent of schools, the board of education, the alleged attackers, and their parents in order to protect the girls while a criminal investigation by his office and a separate investigation by the state Human Rights Commission are underway.\\n\\nThe injunction makes for horrifying reading. Last May, two girls at Burch Middle School in Delbarton, just a few miles north of the West Virginia-Kentucky border, told guidance counselor Hester Keatley that the boys, then in seventh grade, had groped them on several occasions during the year during school hours. The girls also revealed one of their friends, named as “Victim 1” in the injunction, had been assaulted as well. Victim 1 would have reported the abuse sooner, but one of the boys told his crony that a relative who worked for the school system would “take care of us” if anyone complained. The boys were apparently so brazen that they attacked another victim, named as “Victim 2,” in the computer lab.\\n\\nWhen Victim 1 finally revealed what had happened, Keatley assured her that then-principal Jada Hunter knew about the abuse. However, Victim 1’s parents had to demand a meeting with Hunter in order to get any sort of response. The response was almost as hideous as the alleged assault. Even though the father of one of the boys admitted what had happened, Hunter and a teacher on hand to witness the meeting, Melvin Cunningham, told Victim 1’s parents that nothing could be done since there were no witnesses–and that their daughter could potentially be disciplined if she made further complaints without witnesses. Almost as disturbing, it appears that a written statement Victim 1 gave about the abuse before that meeting ended up in the hands of the father of one of the suspects.\\n\\nIt appears that the administrators made good on that threat. Victim 1’s parents made numerous attempts to obtain a copy of the investigation file from the district, but it took until March 2014 to obtain it. After one unsuccessful request in November 2013, Victim 1 was written up by assistant principal Deanna Maynard for allegedly writing an insulting note to another girl and lying about it–but apparently no such note exists. Two months later, Victim 1, now in eighth grade, was abruptly transferred to seventh-grade PE and art classes. This spring, within 24 hours of being interviewed by a state trooper about what happened to her, Victim 2 was written up on what appeared to be false charges of “bullying” for blocking another student on Facebook. The day after that, she was written up again, this time for “insubordination.” Meanwhile, the only discipline faced by the boys has been the loss of ice cream privileges during a day of state testing, as well as a two-day suspension. In the face of such lax discipline, the assaults reportedly continued unabated as late as April 21.\\n\\nEven though no less an authority than the superintendent of schools knew what was happening, no one reported the alleged abuse to the police as required by both state law and school board policy. But according to the injunction, Melissa Webb, who succeeded Hunter as principal in 2013, went further and barred state troopers from talking with students about it on school grounds.\\n\\nFrom the looks of it, at least one head has already rolled for this.? WOWK-TV in Huntington called Webb early Friday afternoon–but got her instead of her answering machine, even though school was in session at the time. The principal’s post is also listed as open on the school’s vacancy site.\\n\\nThe manner in which this was handled contrasts sharply with what happened to Victim 1 in the Jerry Sandusky case, Aaron Fisher. Sandusky repeatedly got Steve Turchetta, the assistant principal at Aaron’s high school, to pull Aaron out of class. This continued even though Turchetta was suspicious of the nature of the relationship between Aaron and Sandusky. When Aaron finally broke down and revealed what was happening to him, principal Karen Probst told Aaron and his mom, Dawn Daniels, to “go home” rather than report it. As of this late stage in the 2013-14 school year, both Probst and Turchetta still have their jobs. Morissey’s swift action makes it all but certain that there will be no repeat of that travesty. Let’s hope he follows through on this. No expense must be spared to ensure everyone responsible for both the abuse and the cover-up are brought to justice.\\n\\nDarrell Lucus is a radical-lefty Jesus-lover who has been blogging for change for a decade.

It passed into Dutch and English hands and by the 18th century they shipped tens of thousands of Africans a year through ‘the door of no return’ onto squalid slave ships bound for plantations of the Americas. European traders would sail to the west coast of Africa with manufactured goods which they exchanged for people captured by African traders. The European merchants would then cross the Atlantic with ships full of slaves on the notorious ‘Middle Passage’. Conditions were so torrid that many of the captors, who often had barely any space to move, did not survive the journey. Those who made the voyage were destined to work on plantations that produced products such as sugar or tobacco for consumption back in Europe. By the end of the 18th Century, campaigners called for the abolition of the trade, but this was fiercely opposed because it was so profitable. After years of campaigning by anti-slavery activists like politician William Wilberforce, Britain banned the trade in slaves from Africa on March 25, 1807. Slavery itself was not outlawed by Britain for another generation, in 1833, and the transatlantic trade continued under foreign flags for many years. Some estimates say as many as 60million people were shipped into bondage. A look back: A map depicts the slave and non-slaveholding states at the outbreak of the Civil War, along with the dates when each non-slaveholding state legally ended slavery But the decision was reversed by President Andrew Johnson after President Abraham Lincoln’s assassination in 1865, it was noted by Al Jazeera America. In 2008, Barack Obama said he did not support reparations to the descendants of slaves, going against the views of around two dozen members of Congress who sponsored legislation to create a commission on slavery. In the same year, the House apologised for slavery, with the Senate following suit in 2009, but neither mentioned compensation. In its lawsuit, Caricom claims slavery condemned the region to a poverty that still afflicts it today. And they are comparing their demand to Germany recompensing Jewish people for the Holocaust and New Zealand compensating Maoris. ‘The awful legacy of these crimes against humanity ought to be repaired for the developmental benefit of our Caribbean societies and all our peoples,’ said Ralph Gonsalves, the prime minister of the tiny Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. He called it a ‘historic wrong that has to be righted’. Verene Shepherd, who is coordinating Jamaica’s demands for reparations, said their slave ancestors ‘got nothing’ when they were freed. ‘They got their freedom and they were told ‘Go develop yourselves’,’ she said. Critics have pointed out that many of Caricom’s members are hardly poor – including millionaire havens such as the Bahamas and Barbados. Prime minister Tony Blair expressed regret for the ‘unbearable suffering’ caused by Britain’s role in slavery in 2007 but made no mention of financial compensation. Britain has said that paying reparations for slavery is the wrong way to address ‘an historical problem’.

       " ('150 years after Charles Darwin’s The Origin of Species there are many open questions in evolutionary biology. For example I have been wavering between the possibility that on the molecular genomic scale evolutionary process is predominantly neutral and stochastic, and a new possibility that selection is pervasive (a new possibility that is actually old). The nice aspect of this area of study today is that empirical data can be brought to bear upon ancient arguments. Previously the dialogues were fruitless in terms of actually resolving opposing viewpoints, as interlocutors dug into their presuppositions, and the same theoretical paradigms flew through data free debates.\\n\\nOne area where this was clear was in relation to the of whether evolutionary process is deterministic or stochastic on the most general level. More prosaically, is evolution an experiment which one can broadly reproduce genetic and functional outcomes over and over? Stephen Jay Gould was the most famous proponent of the position that evolution is not a reproducible experiment. Rather, it is a contingent historical process. You can’t rewind the clock and expect the result to resemble what came before. In contrast Richard Dawkins has tended to defend the stance that there are broad inevitabilities as evolution explores the adaptive space of possibilities (see The Ancestor’s Tale for his detailed position). Over the past few years Joe Thornton’s lab has been looking at this issue by examining the evolutionary genetic trajectory of steroid receptors. This may seem abstruse, but obviously these are functionally significant, and, they’ve been able to utilize ingenious biophysical methods to “rerun” evolution. The general conclusion seems to be that steroid receptors as we understand them are subject to path dependence in a fashion where the outcome is sensitive to unlikely sequences of mutations.\\n\\nThe group now has a paper in Nature, Historical contingency and its biophysical basis in glucocorticoid receptor evolution (ungated). Let me jump straight to the conclusion:\\n\\nIf evolutionary history could be replayed from the ancestral starting point, the same kind of permissive substitutions would be unlikely to occur. The transition to GR’s present form and function would probably be inaccessible, and different outcomes would almost certainly ensue. Cortisol-specific signalling might evolve by a different mechanism in the GR, or by an entirely different protein, or not at all; in each case, GR—or the vertebrate endocrine system more generally—would be substantially different. Because GR is the only ancestral protein for which alternative evolutionary trajectories to historically derived functions have been explored, the generality of our findings is unknown. The specific biophysical constraints, and in turn the degree and nature of contingency, that shape the evolution of other proteins are likely to depend on the particular architecture of each protein and the unique historical mechanisms by which its functions evolved.\\n\\nThe issue about generality is important. Read the whole paper and you’ll be struck by the level of experimental detail that went into making the inferences they arrive at. There’s a reason that these papers get into glamour journals. But is this just a story about a particular class of proteins, or the story of evolution writ large? When molecular evolutionary neutralism became ascendant in the 1980s some responded that though stochasticity might dominate on the sequence level of A, C, G, and T, there was no such randomness when it came to morphology. The power of this argument seems most evident when it comes to the body plans of some metazoans which are clearly dictated by the laws of physics. Marine mammals have evolved toward a morphology which has clear parallels with that of species of the fish lineage which occupy the same niche. Similarly, the elephantine legs of ancient sauropods were no coincidence. As land animals become large their massive bulk becomes unwieldy for more gracile body plans, and there is a tendency toward stout builds, as the cross-section of bone and muscle attempts to race up to the massively increased volume and mass.\\n\\nThe same tension seems to be at play in these sorts of results, which focus on the contingencies of a specific piece of biological machinery. Is there only one way to construct a particular a component due to biophysical constraints? Perhaps. But what does this tell us about the construction of the whole organism, which is the stitching together of innumerable biomolecular parts? In science fiction is not peculiar to imagine worlds where gross morphology is broadly recognizable, but none of the organisms are edible to humans because of divergences in biochemistry. Ultimately as implied in the paper above other groups have to reproduce this sort of work on other families of proteins to see how ubiquitous contingency really is.',\n",

       " ('172 SHARES Facebook Twitter Reddit Stumbleupon Pinterest\\n\\nIn the recent week there have been a number of articles touching on the?wearing of blackface for Halloween and its appropriateness, or rather inappropriateness.? And in reading the comments posted by many it dawned on me, not how many Caucasian Americans are still covert racists, (I don’t need to read an article to know that), but rather how many, not only have no knowledge of American history, but understanding of Sociology 101.\\n\\nIf it weren’t so lamentable it would actually be comical how uneducated the bulk of Americans, especially younger, are.? And by uneducated I’m not referring to formal education but rather the absence of knowledge as one does not need to obtain knowledge solely in the context of brick and mortar institutions.? My grandfather, God rest his soul, was a prime example of this as were many Blacks of African descent prior to our emancipation.\\n\\nAny time one engages in dialogue about a particular subject it is crucial that first, all parties involved actually understand what it is they are speaking on.? One of the unfortunate byproducts of the internet, blogging, and social media sites, is it has made way for the misperception by many that they are somehow knowledgeable or enlightened about a topic when in fact they clearly are not.? If we are going to have a discussion about racism let’s first understand what racism?is.? Perhaps that will prevent unintended rants of ignorance and ridiculous rhetorical questions such as “well what about when the Waynan brothers made the movie White Chicks?? Was that reverse racism?”? Seriously?\\n\\nWe can discuss all you want whether or not White Chicks was bigoted, mean spirited, in bad taste, socially unacceptable, and quite frankly, IMO a horrible expression of art and even worse comedy, however what it was not, was racist.? Why?? Because a movie mocking privileged White women does not negatively impact their daily realities.? It does not prevent them from marrying who they choose.? It does not prevent them from living in the neighborhood of their choice.? It does not prevent them from getting that “dream job”.? And it does not prevent them from walking into Bank of America, Chase Manhattan, et al and getting that loan they request.? Racism is by definition the power to be able to enact your prejudices upon a group of disenfranchised people or member of that group in a manner that is effectual.\\n\\nI can jump up and down all I want and scream “cracka, cracka, cracka….I hate crackas….crackas are this, that”…you get the point, however as hurtful, vile and mean spirited as those words may be they have absolutely no socio-political bearing on the day to day realities of White Americans.\\n\\nFor those who argue “Why should I have to pay for something my ancestors did 100 years ago?? I don’t, nor have?I ever, owned a slave.”? True, there are no chattel slave owners alive today and African-Americans have indeed been emancipated for more than a century.? But that does not change the inconvenient reality that you as?White Americans are the beneficiaries of a 400 year-old system whereby creating a framework that individuals who only look like you, would control and benefit from a financial system wherein, despite Black Americans having a purchasing power of almost $1 trillion annually, the median wealth of whites is still 20 times that of blacks. It’s not coincidental.\\n\\nThis is not about White guilt, a Black president, or Affirmative-Action.? This is about real, earnest dialogue and acknowledgement of where we are as a society and how we came to be here.? To dismiss the actions of certain individuals of a group as heretical is premature and impetuous.\\n\\nWe as members of a society do get our cues from the whole as to what is deemed acceptable as well as unacceptable.? Just as the police officer who abuses or shoots a suspect or the soldier who misuses his authority against “the enemy”.? We all openly engage in behavior which, either spoken or unspoken has been given the?premise?of acceptable.\\n\\nIt is far past time Americans stop pretending just because a Black man is president or that Oprah Winfrey is a billionaire this somehow means racism is ancient history.? That it negates?stop and frisk, the ‘New Jim Crow’, or any of the other social plights of the African-American community. That the murder, and subsequent acquittal of George Zimmerman, was the exception and not the norm. That the other 40,808,823 Blacks in America are balling and blinging, driving their Mercedes?CLS 500 into their garages in lower Manhattan.? It is disingenuous at best.\\n\\nThose who defend the wearing of blackface by touting some ridiculous freedom of speech or artistic expression argument, or?making some lame analogy of a skit or joke made by Dave Chappelle or Chris Rock, are nothing more than closet racists who do not have the gall to admit what it is they’re really feeling.? This is?not?about blackface?but something much more sinister.? This is about the oppression and marginalization of a group of people who don’t look like me.\\n\\nBill Maher said he believed the new racism was denying racism.?

Nobel Prize in Literature 1925 Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay 1938 Pygmalion Signature George Bernard Shaw (26 July 1856 - 2 November 1950) was an Irish playwright and a co-founder of the London School of Economics. Although his first profitable writing was music and literary criticism, in which capacity he wrote many highly articulate pieces of journalism, his main talent was for drama, and he wrote more than 60 plays. He was also an essayist, novelist and short story writer. Nearly all his writings address prevailing social problems with a vein of comedy which makes their stark themes more palatable. Issues which engaged Shaw's attention included education, marriage, religion, government, health care, and class privilege.

       " ('2014 was a shitty year for us politically, but as a community, it was the biggest breakout year since 2003.\\n\\nThe chart above is based on traffic data compiled by Quantcast, and you can see their charts of our traffic here. Our numbers are open and available for anyone to see.\\n\\nWe started using Quantcast in mid-2007, so we only have full-year numbers starting in 2008. As you can see, growth in monthly unique visitors was steady but slight 2008-2011, with a decent bump in 2012, steady through 2013, and then ... last year, when we went from just shy of 91 million monthly uniques to 153 million. Eye-popping!\\n\\nNow to be clear, that\\'s not total annual unique visitors. Rather that\\'s unique visitors measured each month, so if you visited every month last year, you\\'d count as 12 monthly uniques. So basically what the chart above tells us is that in 2008, we averaged about 1.1 million monthly unique visitors. In 2013, it was about 3.9 million, and in 2014, it was 6.8 million.\\n\\nSkipping ahead for a moment, this January? We\\'re already at 9 million. Crazy, huh?\\n\\nBack to the chart above, you see another big trend at play: the falling of pageviews per visitor. That\\'s why overall pageviews were down in 2010, 2011, and 2013 even though the number of unique visitors was up. That\\'s a function of a web-wide shift toward social media outlets, mainly Twitter and Facebook. Today, the Daily Kos Facebook page gets more comments per day than this website does. It\\'s a trend we\\'ve never fought. Remember, our goal is to spread our message far and wide. So if that message ends up on Facebook? Good. There are lots of people there worth talking to. So not only do we NOT fight it, we ENCOURAGE it.\\n\\nStill, even though that has had an effect on the site\\'s page views, all the social-media trends in the world couldn\\'t stop 2014 from going nuts, with almost 440 million pageviews served, compared to just over 300 million in 2013. Again, amazing.\\n\\nDaily Kos is not election-driven anymore\\n\\nCheck out our Quantcast chart from 2014:\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce upon a time, Octobers would kill it during election years, as people tuned in during the runup to the election. This year, we had a decent October (7 million uniques), but nothing like months before and after (8.5 million in both August and November). What was happening? Both those months saw heavy traffic from police-brutality related stories. While I have no doubt that we got a boost from the elections, we\\'re now at a place where we getboosts from other key issues and stories.\\n\\nFacebook and email\\n\\nOur email action list currently numbers 1.56 million, which is smaller than last year, but we purged non-performing, dead, and/or duplicative emails. So our list is legitimately one-and-half million strong.\\n\\nOver at Facebook, we have 668,000 likes. Back in September, when I last checked in with one of these updates, it was around 600,000.\\n\\nMobile\\n\\nSee that chart above, with the light blue and dark blue? Well, the dark blue is mobile traffic. This month, about 61 percent of our traffic is coming from mobile devices. And there\\'s no apparent end to that trend. Fact is, fewer and fewer people are accessing the web from computers.\\n\\nFirst two weeks of January\\n\\nSo it is January and political news isn\\'t particularly compelling. I mean, Republican took control of Congress, and they\\'re doing and saying all sorts of stupid things. Some of you have complained that we\\'ve focused TOO MUCH on those Republicans, but hey, we go where the news cycle takes us. We are a news site after all.\\n\\nYet despite the underwhelming news cycle, we\\'ve just had the best week ever. Check our our lifetime Quantcast stats, broken out by week:\\n\\n\\n\\nLast week was about a third better than our next best week in terms of unique visitors. The mix was 2-1 mobile to web. So rather than depress traffic, it appears that our site and community\\'s focus on stupid Republicans has supercharged traffic. Either that or people are generically re-engaging after last year\\'s shellacking. Actually, I don\\'t know why people are tuning in to these extreme levels, but it suggests one major point: 2014 isn\\'t the apex of Daily Kos\\' potential. We have a ways to go before we max out.\\n\\nDK5 Beta\\n\\nSo a big question is when we\\'ll open up the new version of the site to its public beta period. Well, I don\\'t have an exact date, but we\\'re talking a handful of weeks away. We\\'re really, really close. The team is busy squashing known bugs like \"comments work funky on iPad\", stuff like that. No reason to get you guys to report bugs that we already know exist. Doesn\\'t help us and wastes your time. So we\\'re getting the new site to as close to perfect (to us) as we can get it, before we ask you guys to go ahead and break it to ferret out the remaining bugs.\\n\\nTime-wise, it doesn\\'t help that one of those \"bugs\" was me deciding that part of the publishing workflow was overly complicated, forcing us to rework a significant part of the project. But in the long-run, the changes will make the site far easier for you guys to use, and that\\'s what\\'s ultimately important.\\n\\nIt looks great, and I\\'m super jazzed about what\\'s coming, and I can\\'t wait to share with you.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s not all we\\'re doing. We\\'ve got some incredible projects in the pipeline, all of which will make 2015 the Best Year Ever for this site. Stay tuned. It\\'s going to be a great ride!',\n",

Fine will instead continue his bid for the open HD-54, a light red seat located in Brevard County.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Gravis Marketing surveys hypothetical primary matchups on both sides. The GOP numbers look reasonable enough: Ex-state Attorney General Bill McCollum leads Rep. Ron DeSantis 25-16, with Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera and Rep. Jeff Miller in single digits. McCollum hasn\\'t announced if he\\'s running yet but given his name recognition from his long career in state politics, it\\'s pretty likely he\\'d at least start out with a lead.\\n\\nBut the Democratic primary between announced candidate Patrick Murphy and likely opponent Alan Grayson is where things get more than a little nuts. Grayson posts an insane 63-19 lead, which is very different than what other firms have found. Even the GOP pollster Vox Populi gave Grayson \"only\" a 56-21 edge after they told respondents exclusively negative information about Murphy and positive messages about Grayson. (Their initial numbers gave Murphy a 34-24 lead). Suffice to say, it\\'s very unlikely that 82 percent of Florida Democratic primary voters have already made up their minds and overwhelmingly chosen Grayson at a time when the campaign has barely even begun.\\n\\n• IL-Sen: Ex-Chicago Urban League leader Andrea Zopp will have a lot to prove if she\\'s going to beat Rep. Tammy Duckworth in the Democratic primary to face Sen. Mark Kirk, and her first fundraising report gives us an early peak at how she\\'s doing. Zopp has announced that she\\'s raised $665,000 since she kicked off her campaign in mid-May, which is enough to prove she\\'s credible but still isn\\'t a massive amount in an expensive state like Illinois. Neither Duckworth nor Kirk has revealed their quarterly totals yet.\\n\\n• IN-Sen: Republican Rep. Todd Young hasn\\'t announced if he\\'s running for the state\\'s open Senate seat, but his quarterly fundraising totals don\\'t leave much doubt about his 2016 plans. Young reports hauling in $1 million and has about $2 million on hand, far more than a congressman in a safely red seat would need without a credible primary challenger on the horizon. (Young\\'s money can be transferred from his House account to a Senate campaign once he establishes one).\\n\\n• LA-Sen: GOP Sen. David Vitter still looks like the clear frontrunner in this fall\\'s gubernatorial race, but the battle to succeed him in the Senate is only just beginning. Reps. John Fleming and Charles Boustany and state Treasurer John Kennedy are each hoping that Vitter will appoint them to the upper chamber: Fleming has even publicly said that if Vitter becomes governor, he\\'ll run for this seat in 2016 even if he doesn\\'t get the appointment. Now, the National Journal\\'s Andrea Drusch reports that Boustany just told a group of donors that he\\'s also going to seek this post if Vitter goes to the governor\\'s mansion.\\n\\nBoustany hasn\\'t confirmed anything, but it doesn\\'t look like he\\'s bluffing. Boustany\\'s camp says he\\'s raised $700,000 in the last three months, far more than he\\'d need to defend his safe House seat, and has already hired an experienced campaign manager. Boustany still hopes that he\\'ll earn an appointment and be able to run in 2016 as an incumbent, but it looks like he\\'s all-in regardless unless Vitter\\'s gubernatorial bid somehow goes haywire.\\n\\nIt\\'s anyone\\'s guess what will happen here. If Vitter doesn\\'t choose Fleming or Boustany, they could just decide to back down and run for re-election rather than give up their House seats. Kennedy is up for re-election this fall so he wouldn\\'t be risking his job on a Senate run, but he might decide he can\\'t beat an appointed incumbent. It\\'s a good bet that Vitter will go to bat for his pick, and it may not be easy to defeat someone with his full backing. Tea partier Rob Maness has also hinted that he\\'ll run for the Senate, though he has a lot less to lose than the other three men.\\n\\nHowever, Vitter could always just pick a placeholder who won\\'t seek a full term next year. Vitter would likely be embarrassed if his appointed senator loses re-election, and he might decide that it\\'s easier to avoid the problem altogether. Ultimately, the GOP shouldn\\'t have an issue with holding onto this seat in conservative Louisiana, but we may see an expensive yearlong intra-party brawl.\\n\\n• MD-Sen: Democratic Rep. Donna Edwards has never had a reputation as a solid fundraiser, and this isn\\'t going to help. Edwards\\' camp has announced that they brought in $590,000 during the last three months: To advertise statewide, candidates need to purchase time in both the pricy Baltimore and Washington media markets, and this haul isn\\'t going to buy too many eyeballs. Primary rival Chris Van Hollen hasn\\'t unveiled his quarterly totals yet, but his team says he\\'ll report more than $3.5 million on hand, which would be more than three times what Edwards likely has in the bank.\\n\\n• NH-Sen: While Granite State Democrats are hoping that Gov. Maggie Hassan will challenge Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotte, they\\'ve been scouting out alternatives in case she stays put. However, ex-Rep. and 2010 nominee Paul Hodes is probably one of the last names to come to mind. But Hodes says he\\'s been encouraged to look at a rematch with Ayotte, and isn\\'t ruling anything out if Hassan declines.\\n\\nHodes lost his first bout with Ayotte by a punishing 60-39 margin. Some of this was due to circumstances largely outside his control. New Hampshire swung heavily towards the GOP that year, and it wasn\\'t hard for Team Red to tie Hodes to Obama\\'s unpopular policies. Still, it\\'s pretty hard to feel good about Hodes chances after what happened last time, though New Hampshire\\'s very swingy nature always makes things unpredictable. (Indeed: Hodes lost his 2004 race to Republican Charlie Bass 59-38, before unseating him 53-46 two years later).\\n\\n• OH-Sen, PA-Sen: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has never been shy about dumping money to help their allies, but it\\'s still surprising to see them going on the air this early. Their Pennsylvania spot praises Republican incumbent Pat Toomey as a bipartisan job creator, while their Ohio ad hits Democrat Ted Strickland\\'s economic record as governor. There\\'s no word on the size of either buy, but the Chamber is calling it \"significant.\"\\n\\n• PA-Sen: Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski\\'s odds of taking the Democratic nomination never looked particularly good, and his Senate hopes are almost certainly dead now. On Thursday, the FBI searched Allentown\\'s city hall, and the mayor\\'s office was one of the places they visited. The city claims the FBI was looking for information about contracts, though the bureau has yet to comment. Pawlowski isn\\'t saying much about the probe but he was questioned by agents. And unsurprisingly, Pawlowksi suspended his campaign on Monday, saying he\\'ll \"re-evaluate the race for US Senate once we have a clearer picture of any potential concerns with Allentown’s government.\"\\n\\nState and national Democratic leaders have been openly searching for an alternative to 2010 nominee Joe Sestak, whom they\\'re convinced ran an amateurish campaign against Republican Pat Toomey last time. But Pawlowski never earned much love from Sestak haters, who were unimpressed by his aborted 2014 gubernatorial bid. The Democratic establishment was already looking for another candidate before Thursday and Katie McGinty, the chief of staff to Gov. Tom Wolf and another 2014 candidate, has been getting some attention recently. McGinty hasn\\'t commented publicly, which isn\\'t a surprise given her current post, but we may hear more from her after the state\\'s budget stalemate ends.\\n\\nEx-Rep. Chris Carney, Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams, and state Sen. Vincent Hughes all initially expressed interest in a Senate bid, but they\\'ve been silent for months (though Hughes is also busy with the budget). It\\'s quite possible that the Keystone State Democratic establishment will either need to land McGinty or just reconcile with Sestak.\\n\\nGubernatorial:\\n\\n• LA-Gov: Remember that weird Verne Kennedy poll that Kennedy himself said was misreported? Well, Kennedy finally gave the complete results to Robert Mann, who summarized them on his blog. But honestly, the whole controversy about the poll was more interesting than the actual poll. The initial toplines do indeed show Republican Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle only trailing Democratic state Rep. John Bel Edwards 20-18 in the race for the second place runoff spot (Republican Sen. David Vitter is far ahead with 31). But when Kennedy redistributes African American voters to reflect the usual Democratic performance, Edwards easily edges Angelle 29-17.\\n\\nKennedy also surveyed the likely runoff between Edwards and Vitter, and gave the senator a 45-36 lead. When African Americans are redistributed, the contest stands at a 43-43 tie. However, Kennedy doesn\\'t appear to have redistributed white voters at all, so there\\'s almost certainly a good portion of conservative voters in the undecided sample that will come home to Team Red in November.\\n\\nHouse:\\n\\n• FL-02: Last week, we heard that Mary Thomas, who serves as general counsel at the state Department of Elder Affairs, was interested in challenging freshman Democrat Gwen Graham. And sure enough, Thomas has formed an exploratory committee, and she has a few prominent local Republicans in her corner. Romney carried this North Florida seat 52-47, but Graham proved herself when she unseated Steve Southerland in the midst of last year\\'s GOP wave. Attorney Pete Williams could also challenge Graham, but he\\'s been quiet about his plans.\\n\\n• FL-13: On Friday, St. Petersburg Councilor Darden Rice announced that she would sit out the 2016 contest. Rice said she\\'d reconsider if the state Supreme Court redraws this swing seat to be more Democratic, but it\\'s far from guaranteed that\\'ll happen. Rice\\'s move leaves former Obama Administration official Eric Lynn and ex-Tampa Councilor Mary Mulhern as the only candidates against Republican Rep. David Jolly. Lynn recently posted a solid fundraising total, and he\\'s not going to be shy about reminding primary voters that unlike Mulhern, he\\'s actually from the St. Petersburg area.\\n\\n• FL-18: Over the holiday weekend, lawyer Jonathan Chane announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for this open swing seat. Chane worked with the Obama campaign in 2008 on legal matters, so he may have some connections. However, local Democrats have mostly consolidated behind Palm Beach County Commissioner Melissa McKinlay, who recently unveiled an endorsement from Dave Aronberg, the county\\'s state attorney. Fellow Commissioner Priscilla Taylor is also running for Team Blue.\\n\\nThings have been quite crowded on the GOP side, with five credible candidates already in and more considering. But we won\\'t see a bid from Bill Castle, who serves as general counsel for Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch.\\n\\n• FL-24: Rep. Frederica Wilson doesn\\'t appear to have done anything to upset Democratic voters in her safely blue Miami-area seat, but she\\'s earned a primary challenger anyway. Randal Hill, who played for the Miami Dolphins in the 1995 and 1996 seasons, just quit his job as an agent at the Department of Homeland Security to take on the three-term incumbent. Hill is portraying Wilson as someone who\\'s fine on the issues, but does nothing for the district. Wilson turned back a well-funded 2012 primary challenge from businessman Rudy Moise by a 66-34 margin, and she had no trouble winning renomination last year.\\n\\n• IA-02: Rep. Dave Loebsack is the only Democratic member of the Iowa delegation after last year\\'s GOP wave, and one notable Republican sounds ready to try and finish the job. Iowa Starting Line reports that state Sen. Mark Chelgren has been discussing a possible campaign with party leaders, though Chelgren hasn\\'t said anything publicly yet.\\n\\nWhile Loebsack only pulled off narrow wins in the 2010 and 2014 midterms, he\\'s had little trouble prevailing in presidential cycles in this Obama 56-43 seat. Chelgren\\'s district backed Obama 53-45, and he survived a serious Democratic effort to oust him last year. But Chelgren comes with his own baggage: He made news in 2011 when he compared preschool to Nazi indoctrination, though he\\'s done a better job keeping his inner Steve King in check since then. Loebsack isn\\'t the strongest incumbent ever but if he\\'s in the danger zone next year, Team Red is likely in for another good cycle.\\n\\n• IA-04: Loudmouth Republican incumbent Steve King is always testing the limits of Iowa nice, but he\\'s easily turned back credible Democratic foes in the last two cycles. But Iowa Starting Line reports that Kim Weaver, a local AFSCME official and county Democratic Party chair, is looking to challenge King in this Romney 53-45 seat. Weaver is respected for her work organizing Democrats in reliably red Western Iowa, but King will need to outdo himself if he\\'s going to lose here.\\n\\n• IL-08: The GOP doesn\\'t face great odds in this open Obama 57-41 seat, but one credible Republican sounds ready to give it a shot. DuPage County Commissioner Pete DiCianni says he\\'s strongly considering a campaign here, and will announce his plans sometime in July. A few other Republicans have been mentioned for this seat, but DiCianni is the only one to sound interested. The Democratic primary is currently a three-way contest between businessman Raja Krishnamoorthi, state Sen. Tom Cullerton, and state Sen. Mike Noland (who went from exploring a bid to actually in while we weren\\'t looking).\\n\\n• MD-04: Ex-Lt. Gov. and 2014 gubernatorial nominee Anthony Brown brings us our first poll of the crowded Democratic contest for this safely blue seat. Brown\\'s survey from Fred Yang gives him a 42-20 lead over former Prince George\\'s County State\\'s Attorney Glenn Ivey, with the other candidates each taking no more than 5 percent. It\\'s not a huge surprise that the well-known Brown would start out ahead, though Ivey isn\\'t exactly anonymous here. Ivey\\'s team quickly released a survey from Ron Lester that gave Brown a more-modest 33-27 edge.\\n\\n• MN-08: After Democratic Rep. Rick Nolan\\'s daughter was diagnosed with cancer at the beginning of the year, there were rumors that he would retire. However, Nolan confirms that he\\'ll see a third term (or sixth, if you count his first tour back in the seventies) in this Obama 52-46 Iron Range seat. Nolan narrowly defeated rich guy Stewart Mills last year, and Mills sounds ready to try again.\\n\\n• NV-03: Republican Rep. Joe Heck\\'s decision to run for Senate means that his 50-49 Obama seat is up for grabs. GOP state Senate Majority Leader Michael Roberson hasn\\'t announced anything yet, but he\\'s very likely to jump in soon. But it looks like Las Vegas Councilor Bob Beers won\\'t be challenging him in the primary. Shortly before Heck\\'s announcement, Beers said he wasn\\'t planning to run for Congress and will likely seek re-election instead.\\n\\nOn the Democratic side, the DCCC has spoken with former Secretary of State Ross Miller and state Senate Minority Leader Aaron Ford, but neither man has said anything about their intentions. Other Democrats may start scouting this contest out now that they know Heck is gone, though this isn\\'t going to be an easy race regardless.\\n\\n• NV-04: When you\\'re already one of the most vulnerable incumbents in Congress, you\\'d probably rather avoid reports about how you\\'ve owed millions in unpaid taxes. But while it\\'s never been a secret that freshman Republican Cresent Hardy and his business partners have had financial problems, the Las Vegas Sun finally gives us the full extent of the damage. Among other things, Hardy and his partners have faced business debts and tax liens totaling to $5.3 million. Hardy is arguing that he was a victim of bad economic conditions, which would be a lot more persuasive if he hadn\\'t hit his 2014 primary opponent for some unpaid business taxes of his own.\\n\\n• NY-19: It\\'s taken a surprisingly long time for anyone to jump into the race for this open Upstate New York swing seat, but we may finally have some movement. Ex-Assemblyman and 2006 Republican gubernatorial nominee John Faso has formed an exploratory committee, though he hasn\\'t announced anything yet. Faso\\'s likely to face some primary opposition, with Assemblyman Pete Lopez showing the most interest. (Hat-tip Politics1)\\n\\n• OH-06: Republican Rep. Bill Johnson hasn\\'t appeared on many target lists after easily dispatching briefly-touted rival Jennifer Garrison last year, but one prominent local Democrat isn\\'t closing the door on a bid. State Sen. Lou Gentile tells the Youngstown Vindicator\\'s David Skolnick that \"all options are open\" for 2016, and that he\\'ll be making a decision soon.\\n\\nRomney won this eastern Ohio seat 55-43, but likely Democratic Senate nominee Ted Strickland represented the last incarnation in the House and performed well in the area during his unsuccessful 2010 re-election campaign for governor. Gentile thinks that Strickland and Hillary Clinton will boost Team Blue\\'s fortunes here, and he may be able to ride the tide to victory. Gentile won an expensive state Senate race in 2012 by a 52-48 as Romney was carrying the district 51-46, so he does have experience winning over crossover voters.\\n\\nBut Skolnick thinks that Gentile is leaning towards running for re-election, and notes that there really aren\\'t any other credible Democratic candidates here. Johnson also hasn\\'t done much to offend conservative voters, and he won\\'t be easy to beat in any case.\\n\\nOther Races:\\n\\n• Specials: If a Tuesday goes by without a special election in New Hampshire, did it really happen?

       " (\"30 Years Later, the Lessons from Mount St. Helens\\n\\nBY BRIAN THOMAS, M.S. * | THURSDAY, MAY 20, 2010\\n\\nOn May 18, 1980, a tremendous landslide on the northern side of Mount St. Helens in Washington state uncapped a violent volcanic eruption, completely altering the surrounding landscape. It is the most studied volcano in history and has reshaped thinking regarding catastrophic earth processes. The Institute for Creation Research has studied the volcano over the past three decades, conducting research that has provided a suite of informative lessons with broad-ranging implications.1\\n\\nFor example, the rapid outflow from the volcano caused massive amounts of sediment to fill in the entire valley adjacent to the mountain. And a 1982 dam breach of the snow-melt lake that had formed in the mountain's crater caused a catastrophic flood that tore a gash through those fresh deposits from two years earlier. To this day, the resulting steep-sided canyon walls can be seen,2 showing that horizontal sediment layers hundreds of feet thick were formed within hours during the eruption. This sparks the question: what other layered sedimentary rocks in earth's crust were formed rapidly?\\n\\nThe mountain also provided a clear reason to distrust the reliability of radiometric dating. A new rock cap atop the mountain that formed after the 1980 eruption should have shown it to be on the order of tens of years. But standard analysis gave the totally incorrect date of 350,000 years.3 What other rocks have been dated incorrectly by following those standard dating protocols?\\n\\nAnd in a strange but profound way, Mount St. Helens offered a significant new interpretation of coal deposits. Many logs were transported by the blast to nearby Spirit Lake. As they jostled and shifted in the water, the bark rubbed off and sank to the bottom of the lake to form a sheet of waterlogged bark. Elsewhere, extensive masses of coalified deposits are also made of tree bark.4 Could the tree bark-rich coal beds have been formed by a catastrophe even more massively destructive than Mount St. Helens?\\n\\nThe equipment and techniques used to track and predict volcanic eruptions have improved dramatically since 1980, thanks in part to lessons learned while tracking post-eruption tremors near to Mount St. Helens. During the 1990s, the volcano produced some solid chunks of magma material, even though it had been thought that magma was entirely liquid.5\\n\\nExperts at the time of the 1980 eruption predicted that the area would take perhaps hundreds of years to rebound. Yet after only 20 years, biologists noted the speedy recovery of plants and animals on what had been a vast moonscape.6 Today, the 30-year-old blast zone is a lushly treed forest. Creation science models based on the records of Genesis expected to see this happen, since Genesis discloses that God created creatures for the very purpose of “filling” the earth,7 and since after the Flood the creatures aboard the Ark were able to quickly adapt to the new environments produced by the cataclysm.\\n\\nBecause of the Mount St. Helens eruption, scientists know that sedimentary rock layers can form in only hours, rather than requiring millions of years. It also showed that radiometric dating is not necessarily accurate and that God gave animals and plants the ability to rapidly re-colonize barren land. And the improved seismic prediction techniques that Mount St. Helens facilitated have also increased scientific understanding of earth's geologic activities.\\n\\nBut as much as Mount St. Helens has already revealed, surely it has more mysteries for researchers to uncover as investigations into its past and present processes continue.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n* Mr. Thomas is Science Writer at the Institute for Creation Research.\\n\\nArticle posted on May 20, 2010.\",\n",

       " ('40 More Years: How the Democrats Will Rule the Next Generation\\n\\nBy James Carville\\n\\nSimon and Schuster\\n\\nNew York, New York: 2009\\n\\n209 pages\\n\\n$24.95\\n\\n\"American presidential politics is generally not a back-and-forth enterprise. There are eras in which one party dominates. Today, a Democratic majority is emerging, and it\\'s my hypothesis, one I share with a great many others, that his majority will guarantee the Democrats remain in power for the next forty years.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s already too late to hold back the people who\\'ve rushed to the comment section without reading even this far in to the essay to declare that predicting the future is stupid, that nobody should predict that we\\'ll win because then Democrats will get lazy or something, and to say they dislike James Carville. It\\'s too bad if that happens, because it\\'s a worthwhile discussion to have.\\n\\nCarville has been a wildly successful political operative; he managed a decisive Democratic win over an incumbent Republican president, several statewide races and, since 1992, has been probably the most successful international political consultant, playing key roles in the victories of Tony Blair, Ehud Barak and several others. His crusade against DNC chair Howard Dean was petty, misguided and unproductive. But he\\'s still a supremely talented operative and observer of American politics.\\n\\nCarville\\'s success in electing center-left candidates in the US and across the globe gives him a rare practitioner\\'s perspective on what\\'s become a major discussion among political observers; namely, are the Republicans screwed, and are the Democrats embarking upon a period of dominance. American politics has tended to operate on roughly 40 year cycles, especially since the late 19th century. Over the last decade or so there\\'s been reason to think that Democrats were on the verge of partisan realignment favoring Democrats. Looking at these trends, in November 2007 I began to discuss (here, here, here and here ) the parallels between the election of 1932 and what we could see in the approaching election of 2008. The victory of Barack Obama and expansion of our Congressional majorities, and the reception so far of the electorate to the Obama administration and the Democratic Congress, give further support to the belief that Democrats could dominate the political and policy agenda of the next several decades, control Congress and win the majority of presidential elections until mid-century or so.\\n\\nCarville should have valuable contributions to this discussion. Unfortunately, 40 More Years doesn\\'t offer much to one looking for sound historical, political and demographic evidence and arguments for whether and why the country may be undergoing a political realignment away from the transitional period since Nixon\\'s 1968 victory that hastened the end of the New Deal order that dominated American politics since 1932. Nevertheless, anyone looking for excellent arguments for why voters should choose Democrats should read what is an engaging and very effective polemic.\\n\\nPart of Carville\\'s shtick, which has made him the most famous and recognized political operative since Pat Buchanan, is his rapid-fire, associative, sometimes even frenetic verbal style. 40 More Years is written in that voice, which makes it a quick and entertaining read. However, it\\'s a weakness for a book that suggests it will deliver an extended argument; indeed, a lot of the book has a \"oh, another thing I just thought of have to throw in\" feel.\\n\\nAs much as an extended argument that Carville has is summed up at the beginning of the first chapter:\\n\\nThe Republicans got spanked in 2008, and they\\'re going to keep getting spanked. The explanation is simple: • They\\'ve destroyed the myth of conservative competence.\\n\\n• They\\'re corrupt.\\n\\n• They\\'ve lost the culture war.\\n\\nThat argument really isn\\'t wrong, it\\'s just that it\\'s incomplete. Carville sees an opening provided by the Republican meltdown. While he doesn\\'t discuss it, that opening was provided by the narrow but decisive Republican victories in 2002 and 2004, which for the first time since the early 1950\\'s gave them complete control of the executive and legislative branches, and thus exposed them as solely responsible for whatever went wrong. And what went wrong during that four year period was a shallow and jobless recovery from a recession, the beginnings of the collapse of the housing market, Republicans overplaying their hands and pursuing horribly unpopular positions on Social Security privatization and interfering in the end-of-life decisions for Terri Schaivo, and exposing their gross incompetence in dealing with hurricane Katrina and the civil war, ethnic cleansing and general chaos in Iraq that peaked just prior to the Democrats\\' victories in the 2006 election.\\n\\nWhat\\'s missing, however, is that these trends have been brewing since the early 90\\'s. Carville mentions Kevin Phillips\\' (surprisingly out-of-print) The Emerging Republican Majority, but he doesn\\'t mention John Judis and Ruy Teixeira\\'s 2002 book The Emerging Democratic Majority, who predicted a Democratic realignment not because of Republican incompetence but more because of long-term trends creating a Democratic majority:\\n\\nToday\\'s Democrats are the party of the transition from urban industrialization to a new postindustrial metropolitan order in which men and women play equal roles and in which white America is supplanted by multiracial, multiethnic America. This transition is occurring in the three critical realms of work, values and geography.\\n\\nProfessionals and highly educated workers are growing in numbers and prominence, and they are voting Democratic. Work is important to Americans, but so are pleasure and personal satisfaction, and Democrats have favored more family-friendly policies of the types found in the social welfare states like Canada and Europe and a embrace of cultural tolerance and diversity. Democrats have championed social libertarianism in people\\'s personal lives, which is in tune with the changes in society and a stark contrast to the censorious intolerance of the Republicans, who initially benefitted from a backlash to the civil rights and feminist movements. And the rural share of the national vote, which leans conservative, is declining, and population growth is heavily concentrated in centers dominated by what Richard Florida has defined as the creative class.\\n\\nCarville doesn\\'t touch on much of this, other than some cursory comments on the youth vote. He also barely discusses the financial backing of Democrats; typically, realignments coincide with shifts of significant--and ascendant--sectors of industry allying themselves with the rising party. Carville mentions that Democrats raised a ton of money in 2008, but doesn\\'t really examine it deeply. He mentions Daily Kos and other blogs, but again, his examination is cursory and not particularly enlightening, and other than raving about Media Matters for America, he doesn\\'t really talk about the corrective role that progressive media has been playing with the traditional media.\\n\\nLike the partisan warrior he is, Carville focuses heavily on Republican failures and Democratic hagiography. Fox News lies, Sarah Palin is an extremist simpleton, Hillary Clinton is great, Bill Clinton was a good president, the Republicans stole the 2000 election in Florida, and again and again, the Bush administration helped bring about the post-Katrina disaster in Carville\\'s beloved New Orleans.\\n\\nCarville does not, however discuss the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and the ugly reaction the Bush administration helped engineer for their rank political gain in 2002 and 2004. Again, it was Judis who, in a 2007 article about empirical psychological studies on terrorism and the American electorate, described the political effects of those attacks, and why they helped stall the Democratic realignment:\\n\\nIn the months after September 11, most Americans were caught up in the same reaction to the tragedy--and that included adulation for Bush, even among many Democrats. But over the next few years, faced with two elections, Bush had to maintain his popularity; and he did so by constantly reviving memories of that dark day. As the 2002 election approached, voters turned their attention to the recession, as well as Enron and other scandals--all to the Democrats\\' favor. At that point, Bush, who had stood aside in the November 2001 gubernatorial elections that Democrats won, sought to base the 2002 election on terrorism. Bush and Karl Rove used the full arsenal of scare tactics to evoke fears of another September 11. The result was that the electorate became sharply polarized between conservatives and liberals and between Republicans and Democrats, while those caught in the middle tended to side with the Republicans--exactly as the psychologists\\' experiments might have predicted.\\n\\nConservatives and conservative-leaning swing-voters were susceptible to appeals based on fear, and these appeals took people\\'s attention away fom the long-term advantages held by Democrats. (The timidity of the Democratic response to Bush\\'s fearmongering also appears to have suppressed Democratic voting enthusiasm, especially in 2002.) But as the war, Katrina, Social Security and Terri Schaivo overpowered terrorism as a concern for voters—and frankly, four years worth of older people (who were especially susceptible to the terror and anti-gay messages) dying and young liberal voters entering the electorate, by 2006 the realignment predicted by Judis and Teixeira in 2002 resumed, and appears to have accelerated in 2008.\\n\\nCarville doesn\\'t discuss the long-term trends, but he does focus more attention than I\\'ve previously seen on a memo written after the 2000 election by Bush pollster Mathew Dowd. For Carville, that memo—we only know of its existence because of reporting, as nobody outside the Bush inner circle has read it—is the seed of the Republican demise. It was in that memo that Dowd pushed the conclusion that, contrary to how they campaign in 2000, the Bush administration could safely ignore appealing to the center of the electorate, because, he argued, almost nobody is persuadable, so the goal should be ginning up Republican base turnout. And to do that, the administration governed in a manner almost entirely geared toward pleasing the extreme of the GOP base.\\n\\nHad it not been for 9-11 and the Bush fearmongering, Republicans probably would have taken a bath in the 2002 and 2004 elections. The perverse result of their staving off Dem advances in those two elections was their perfidy and incompetence were allowed to achieve new depths, and the resulting collapse in 2006 and 2008 probably seem to people more tied to the Republican collapse. In reality, what would probably have been happening more incrementally over the previous elections was, like water held back by a damn, a more devastating torrent when it finally broke loose in 2006 and 2008. Thus, Dowd\\'s memo shouldn\\'t be given disproportionate influence for the seeming Democratic realignment, but it can be given credit for the intensity of the swing toward Democrats in the last two elections.\\n\\nMuch of 40 More Years is dedicated to arguing that Democrats are right and Republicans are wrong. (An earlier Carville book is even titled We\\'re Right, They\\'re Wrong: A Handbook for Spirited Progressives) However, being right isn\\'t necessarily correlated with winning elections. You win elections typically because whether you\\'re right or wrong, your candidates and party are trusted, and they\\'re usually trusted because voters think your candidates and party share their values and agree with them on what they want from government.\\n\\nCarville even acknowledges elsewhere in the book that this is the case when he declares that there have only been two \"Big Ideas\" since LBJ\\'s Great Society—supply-side economics and neoconservative—and \"they were new, bold, easy to explain, and profoundly stupid.\" Carville, building on Roosevelt\\'s New Deal and Truman\\'s Fair Deal, offers up the slogan the Real Deal. But he admits that he doesn\\'t have the elements that will make up the core of the next Big Idea. That\\'s now largely in the hands of the Obama administration, and their success—and the alternating cooperation and productive prodding they need from the Democratic Congress—will determine whether Democrats can solidify their emerging majority.\\n\\nDespite being weak on long-term analysis, Carville\\'s book is, however, an excellent polemic. It contains numerous worthwhile insights, such as his claim that in a parliamentary system a leader who responded like Bush did to Katrina would probably have been immediately voted out of power. There\\'s a good section called Res Judicata on how to shut down Republican attempts to argue on settled subjects, mostly matters that the Republicans have tried to remove from the realm of science and empirical study and replace with matters of faith. And anyone who wants to talk about why Democrats do a far better job of providing economic growth that spreads throughout the population. Much of the raw data comes from Unequal Democracy: The Political Economy of the New Gilded Age (reviewed here by SusanG), but Carville, like any good consultant, does a great job of framing the arguments. It should be required reading for every ad maker, press operative and Democratic candidate.\\n\\nThere\\'s no correct answer to the question to whether we\\'re in the beginning of an age of Democratic party dominance; it\\'s too early to know. There are better arguments than the one provided by James Carville in 40 More Years. But following his advice on how to talk to voters and shut down stupid crap from Republicans could help Democrats lock in that realignment.',\n",

You can get your hands on one of these condos for the princely sum of $1 million.\\n\\nPeter Young, a 44-year old attorney living at Trump Towers, has said the entire situation is “it’s been a little embarrassing.” He states that rather than saying he lives at Trump Towers, he says he “lives on the river.”\\n\\nAn older woman, who didn’t want to be named, tells people she “rents from a doctor” rather than allowing herself to be associated with anything related to Donald Trump. She then went on to say “I’m worried about a terrorist attack against the building. I wish he’d shut up.”\\n\\nWhile Trump doesn’t own the building, his name continues to be emblazoned on it in 20-foot high letters.\\n\\nIt’s undeniable that Trump’s comments in the media are having an impact on his brand. According to Tim Calkins, a professor of marketing at North Western University’s Kellog School of Management. He suggests that Trump’s brand was linked to success, wealth and luxury. However, it may start to be linked with “extremism and negative things”\\n\\nCalkins also believes the Trump hype will die down once the campaign is over. “He has everybody’s attention now, but people won’t be so interested once the campaign is over.” Let’s hope so.\\n\\nContinue reading below the advertisement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump has already lost many deals and endorsements due to his comments on Mexicans, calling them “criminals” and “rapists.” Macy’s, NBC Universal, and a suburban brewery have all pulled out of doing business with Trump.\\n\\nBoycotting Trump is certainly one way to get rid of him.

       " ('7 Badass Comedians Who Refused to Sell Out\\n\\nEditor\\'s note: This article was first published in 2011.\\n\\nMany comedians have altered their careers after stumbling into wild-party lifestyles, but what about those who’ve switched it up because of their political beliefs? It’s not all wine, sex and song out there. The following funny folks have changed their lives for progressivism -- some on purpose, some not so much -- and made us laugh in the process.\\n\\n1. Dave Chappelle\\n\\nIn 2005, after a long stint on Comedy Central with a critically acclaimed, and critically funny show, Dave Chappelle was perceived to have gone crazy. He ditched the million-dollar \"Chappelle Show\" at the height of its popularity and dropped out of society, only to emerge months later on \"Oprah\" to admit he’d escaped to South Africa for a time before returning to his small hometown in Ohio. He didn’t lose his mind; he was fed up by the suits and their expectations, telling Oprah, \"When you’re a guy who generates money, people have a vested interested in controlling you.\"\\n\\nBut it was more than that. Chappelle was worried that his brand of humor -- centered around skewering racist stereotypes with a subversive, sophisticated, line-treading light -- was getting lost on his ever-expanding audience. The final straw: while filming a skit about \"the black pixie,\" in which he dressed up as a Jim Crow minstrel and chided himself to play into black stereotypes, a white crew member laughed just a little too hard. \"When he laughed, it made me uncomfortable,\" Chappelle said at the time. \"As a matter of fact, that was the last thing I shot before I told myself I gotta take time out after this. Because my head almost exploded.\"\\n\\nChappelle didn’t drop out completely. Five years later, he lives with his wife and children on a farm in Ohio, but still does the occasional show and is a fairly active and cantankerous tweeter. So why do people still think he went bonkers? And he’s not the first comedian whose progressive politics have clashed with or been overshadowed by the politricks of showbiz.\\n\\n2. Richard Pryor\\n\\nThe original. If culture can indeed shift the political conversation, Pryor’s brilliantly funny, unfalteringly scathing send-ups on race relations -- or non-relations, as it were -- were some of the most important jokes in history. Inspired by the civil rights movement, during a stint in Vegas in 1967 Pryor had a revelation that his tame act wasn’t going to work for him anymore. Reportedly, he stepped on stage, peered out to the crowd and said \"What the fuck am I doing here?\" before he dropped the mic, walked off and changed his act forever.\\n\\nUnfortunately, despite being one of the best comedians in American history (if not the best, as Comedy Central asserts), he’s still remembered for that one fateful day in 1980 when, caught in the throes of drug addiction, he accidentally lit himself on fire while freebasing cocaine after chugging 150-proof alcohol. Richard Pryor was no saint -- he’s only one of the myriad comedians who’ve had drug problems, and he was a horrible abuser of women -- but the way he captured his cynical reality for a nation still trying to navigate race relations was and is important and unparalleled.\\n\\nIncidentally, Rain Pryor, Richard’s third child, is continuing his legacy. After a long career as an actress, she still tours off her 2005 one-woman comedy show, \"Fried Chicken and Latkes,\" which delves into her experiences growing up black and Jewish in the 1970s.\\n\\n3. George Carlin\\n\\nAcross the board, Carlin was one of the most progressive, fascinating, funny and smart comedians America has ever produced. He was making jokes about global warming before climate deniers even knew it was a thing, spoofed his own clan of hippies on national television, and got arrested with Lenny Bruce. Incidentally, he, too had his own bout with drug addiction; it never resulted in the same public brouhaha as Pryor’s, but apparently in the 1970s everyone with a joke in one pocket was carrying a bag of cocaine in the other.\\n\\nBut it was in 1973 that his politics caught up to him. Defiant against profanity laws and the ridiculous nature of words being seen as dangerous, he delivered a variation on his famous \"Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television\" speech (shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits) on New York’s progressive public radio station WBAI. The FCC promptly pounced, filing with the U.S. Supreme Court. Amazingly, the ruling was in WBAI and Carlin’s favor, stating that the routine was not indecent, and that the FCC could prohibit \"adult\" programs during the hours kids were up. It was a small step for a man, a giant step for comedy.\\n\\n4. Paul Mooney\\n\\nIn the great American tradition of comedians mining race relations for bits, Mooney’s one of the best and most unflinching, having written for great shows from Pryor to \"In Living Color\" to Chappelle. And like his cohort Pryor, who declared he would no longer use the n-word in his routines after a life-changing trip to Africa, Mooney made a similar change of his own. It was nominally less revelatory, though, and definitely less joyous. In 2006, white comedian Michael Richards -- best known as Kramer on \"Seinfeld\" -- went on a racist tirade during a stand-up act, repeatedly calling a member of the audience the n-word. In disgust, Mooney declared he would never again use any form of the word. \"We\\'re gonna stop using the n-word,\" he said in a CNN interview. \"I\\'m gonna stop using it. I\\'m not gonna use it again and I\\'m not gonna use the b-word. And we\\'re gonna put an end to the n-word. Just say no to the n-word. We want all human beings throughout the world to stop using the n-word.\"\\n\\n5. Judy Tenuta\\n\\nThe longtime feminist and early enlightener of midlife crises everywhere -- her \"sorry about your penis\" joke from the ‘80s remains classic -- Tenuta’s sarcasm and punch garnered her a huge following of gays and lesbians through the years. And so, in 2008, right after California legalized gay marriage for that brief and idyllic time, Tenuta became an ordained minister in that state in order to marry her same-sex-loving fans, whom she calls \"gay love slaves\" and \"lesbertarians.\" Alas, as the gay marriage issue is tied up in California courts, Tenuta’s marriage-granting is sidelined, and she’s been relegated to Lady Gaga spoofs.\\n\\n6. Patton Oswalt\\n\\nHe is best known for dominating the commercial end of things, writing for MADTV, acting on prime-time sitcoms and doing voice-overs for animated films like Ratatouille. But in the mid-2000s, spurred by the Bush administration, his left trajectory seemed to become increasingly visible, with more stand-up in his repertoire and W criticisms at the ready and organizing benefits for our old friend, former presidential candidate John Kerry. He even shouted out AlterNet! What up, Oswalt! Bush altered everyone, true, but now Oswalt’s influencing the culture more than ever, writing columns for Wired, appearing in the \"United States of Tara\" and making great statements on serious topics like Egypt and Obama.\\n\\n7. Pee-Wee Herman aka Paul Reubens\\n\\nThis one’s more of an honorable mention. In the late ‘80s, Pee-wee Herman, the infantile man with a gray suit and a devious chuckle was doing everyone a favor with the imaginative show, \"Pee Wee’s Playhouse,\" which was lauded for its multiculturalism and open-mindedness. In 1987, he told Rolling Stone, \"I\\'m just trying to illustrate that it\\'s okay to be different — not that it\\'s good, not that it\\'s bad, but that it\\'s all right. I\\'m trying to tell kids to have a good time and to encourage them to be creative and to question things.\"\\n\\nIt was a beautiful run -- until 1991, when Reubens was arrested in a Florida adult theater for public masturbation, vilified by the media and dropped by CBS. Certainly it was a case of revisionism; though he was ostensibly making a children’s show, the Pee-wee Herman stand-up show originated with very adult jokes -- sex was a main topic -- which he toned down later before making his film Pee-wee’s Big Adventure. Public masturbation is illegal, of course, but he was in an adult theater, not a park -- if anywhere’s appropriate to do it, it’s there. But the puritanical public got its way, and Reubens slipped into obscurity for many years. Last year, though, \"Pee-Wee’s Playhouse\" was revived for an enormously successful Broadway comeback.',\n",

       " ('9/11: the Movie\\n\\n, the Chicago Tribune and Utne Magazine. Anthony Kaufman has written about films and the film industry for the New York TimesChicago TribuneUtne Magazine\\n\\nThe Sept. 11 attacks, it has often been noted, looked eerily similar to a Hollywood blockbuster. With Universal Pictures\\' \"United 93,\" the first event-movie of the summer, we have arrived full circle.While it may be impossible to put aside the actual catastrophic happenings of that day, that\\'s exactly what I\\'d like to do for the purposes of this discussion. Forget, momentarily, the recently released transcript of flight 93\\'s data recorder and the questions of whether it\\'s too soon or not soon enough, respectful or exploitive. Just take a look at \"United 93\" -- which opens today -- for what it is: a movie, but more specifically, a gut-wrenching disaster movie, complete with regular American folks who turn into heroes and a collection of authority figures that don\\'t know their ass from their elbow. How does this piece of media function -- as a jingoistic call to arms, or a searing indictment of power?\"United 93,\" in some ways, accomplishes both, following the blueprint for the disaster movie genre cultivated in the 1970s with such calamitous camp classics as \"The Towering Inferno,\" \"Earthquake\" and, of course, the movie that started it all, \"The Poseidon Adventure.\" (Is it just a coincidence that \"Poseidon,\" Hollywood\\'s new big-budget remake of the survival tale, opens just two weeks after \"United 93\"?)The \\'70s disaster flicks arrived during a period of profound crisis in our nation\\'s history, when the Vietnam War had reached the breaking point, and the government was losing its grip. (The successful release of \"The Poseidon Adventure\" coincided with Nixon\\'s reelection in 1972 and the Watergate hearings in \\'73.) With capsized cruise liners, burning buildings and even killer bees, these films trafficked in destruction, panic and mass death. But they also showed off the indubitable spirit of disparate citizens who bonded together to keep the American Dream alive. As pop-philosopher Slavoj Zizek has said, \"What fascinates me about disaster films is how circumstances of vast catastrophe suddenly bring about social cooperation.\"If it sounds like right-wing pablum, it often is. The \\'70s disaster cycle was famous for killing off the corrupt privileged and sexually active, while the righteous and wholesome end up saved or majestically martyred. In the original \"Poseidon Adventure,\" it is a preacher (played by Gene Hackman) and a working-class cop (Ernest Borgnine) who lead a small group of passengers to safety. That the preacher also dies doesn\\'t diminish his stature, because -- to use President Bush\\'s propagandistic rhetoric -- he made the \"the ultimate sacrifice.\"\"United 93\" is also a story of ordinary Americans who die in a catastrophe. And like its predecessors, the movie reflects a deep distrust of authority. In a Hollywood-created crisis, whether it\\'s \"The Towering Inferno,\" \"Die Hard\" or \"United 93,\" you can\\'t trust the corporate suits or military units; always stick with blue-collar stalwarts such as the renegade cop, courageous fire chief or resourceful flight attendant.In \"United 93,\" the governmental incompetence on display is staggering. Air-traffic operators speak of a \"possible hijack\" about 25 minutes before the first plane hits the World Trade Center, but like some nightmare game of telephone, the information gets passed from Command Centers to Federal Aviation Administration to Northeast Air Defense with little efficiency or clarity. According to the film, CNN knows more about the crisis than anyone in charge. For all the moving blips on the radar screens, the systems of power are totally in the dark. \"How long is it going to take to get that authority?\" we hear repeatedly.This may sound like a hard-hitting criticism of our current leadership (indeed, Bush and Cheney are depicted as unreachable throughout the course of the attacks). But the film\\'s distrust of high muckety-mucks ultimately reinforces the renegade populism of the Bush presidency -- and more widely, the American western mythology. Again, the valiant individuals on the hijacked plane have always provided the potency behind the real-life story of the doomed flight 93.While the film smartly eschews the Hollywood habit of masquerading celebrities as ordinary Americans, instead using a cast of unknowns, there is the familiar strategy of introducing the characters before the big calamity through a mishmash of brief scenes that mix the banal and the excruciatingly tense -- here, made all the more agonizing through handheld cameras, ominous music and the continuous delaying of the hijack. (It does not begin until about a full hour into the film.)But unlike standard disaster movies, we\\'re given even less access to our surrogates. At the airport terminal and on board waiting for takeoff, we pick up only snippets of conversations about wives and kids, planned vacations and business dealings. Yet the characters\\' lack of depth is intentional.These are not fully fleshed-out people; they symbolize a diverse band of American brothers and sisters who fight back against a common enemy.There are a few characters, however, who briefly stand out: a first-class Caucasian latecomer with a baseball cap and blocky build who has \"sportsman\" -- and average American hero -- written all over him; a German blond businessman who turns out as a stereotypically weak-kneed Euro-pacifist (an obvious non-American who is eventually neutralized); and the FAA\\'s Ben Sliney (played by the real Sliney), who while ineffectual, at least appears angry at the ineptitude surrounding him. He\\'s the only ornery, likeable figurehead: Think Walter Matthau in \"The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3\" or Charles Durning in \"Dog Day Afternoon.\"Then there are the terrorists. British director Paul Greengrass (the estimable filmmaker behind \"Bloody Sunday,\" a docudrama about the 1972 British massacre of Irish protestors) opens the film not with Americans, but with the prayers of Islamic extremists. He does not demonize these men, but portrays them as frightened and nervous. In a nuanced depiction that may enrage right-wingers, their leader, who eventually pilots the plane, comes across as downright sympathetic -- a slim man with glasses who, before boarding, calls someone on his cell phone and whispers in German, \"Ich liebe dich\" (\"I love you\").In fact, one of the best scenes in the film -- which comes near the end -- links both terrorists and victims in this epic human tragedy. In a series of brief shots, we see hijackers and passengers praying alike. Whether Islamic or Judeo-Christian, there are no atheists inside downward-spiraling airplanes -- and everyone on the flight, for one brief moment, is united by fear of death and pleas for salvation.For the secular, the montage may smack of the religiosity in many apocalyptic Hollywood visions and the source for so much of the world\\'s current quagmire. And while that may be true, it\\'s also a rare instance of humanness in a film filled with pounding thuds on the soundtrack, occasional bursts of gruesome violence and, depending on how you look at it, a celebration of American vengeance. The film climaxes with the bloody revolt of the passengers.About three weeks ago, an early version of \"United 93\" screened for critics that ended with the title card: \"America\\'s war on terror had begun.\" The neocon-cowboyish clarion call has since been cut from the film. But the sentiment still reigns.',\n",

       " ('961 SHARES Facebook Twitter Reddit Stumbleupon Pinterest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor some reason, Donald Trump and his insane message is resonating with Republican voters, giving him a sizable lead over his competition Ted Cruz and John Kasich. However, Trump may not actually be able to get the nomination outright.\\n\\nThe Republican National Convention requires that a nominee obtain 50% of the delegates plus one to clinch the nomination. That means Donald Trump needs 1,237 pledged delegates. Since he currently sits at 739 with Cruz and Kasich making some advances (okay, mostly Cruz), he may fall short when the voting is done.\\n\\nWhat does that mean? Well, pledged delegates are supposed to vote for their pledged candidate during the first round of voting at the RNC. If a majority is not reached, more rounds of voting will take place, with some of the delegates becoming unpledged. That means they can vote for whomever they want.\\n\\nA type of underhanded tactic has been taking place behind the scenes, one which Trump was ignorant to until recently because, well, he doesn’t know jack about politics. But Ted Cruz and GOP officials (who hate Trump, and who hate Cruz only slightly less) have been trying to plant loyalists in the delegates being selected to go to the convention.\\n\\nIt’s a smart tactic that Trump hadn’t been engaged in until recently. If some of Trump’s delegates become unpledged, they can jump ship over to Cruz’s or someone else’s side and steal away the nomination. Some wonder if enough damage has already been done to possibly steal the nomination away in a contested convention.\\n\\nSome of these behind-the-scenes activities taking place in certain states may really stack the deck against Trump. For instance, in Connecticut, while candidates can nominate their own delegates, final say goes to the state party. In other states like Wisconsin, some delegates are selected by the state party leaders, while others are nominated (but not selected outright) by the candidates. Rules like this could aid in stealing away a Trump nomination.\\n\\nContinue reading below the advertisement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump, in an effort to stem the bleeding, has sent Ben Carson to North Dakota in an attempt to make sure some Trump loyalists are being selected to go to the convention in July. Trump didn’t seem to find this whole process very entertaining. He said on ABC’s “This Week”:\\n\\n“I have a guy going around trying to steal people’s delegates. This is supposed to be America, a free America. You know, welcome to the Republican Party. What’s going on in the Republican Party is a disgrace. I have so many more votes and so many more delegates. And, frankly, whoever at the end, whoever has the most votes and the most delegates should be the nominee.”\\n\\nYeah well, that’s not how it works. You need a majority. Also, why would you send Carson to do anything? Not only does he look like he might just fall asleep and forget what he was supposed to be doing there, his monumentally terrible endorsement of you shouldn’t inspire confidence in him.\\n\\nBut we shouldn’t expect Donald Trump to think things through, should we?\\n\\nFeatured image by Gage Skidmore, available under a Creative Commons 2.0 license.\\n\\n961 SHARES Facebook Twitter Reddit Stumbleupon Pinterest',\n",

That’s a must in order to use the obscure procedure known in Senate parlance as reconciliation, which allows lawmakers to avoid the 60-vote filibuster hurdle and pass bills on a simple majority vote. […] The conundrum has many on the far right urging GOP leaders to take on the Senate parliamentarian, who will ultimately rule what can and cannot be repealed through reconciliation, and try to repeal the entire law using a one- or two-line sentence that simply reads: \"Repeal the Affordable Care Act.\" But policymakers and staff working on the matter are finding it\\'s not so straightforward. The so-called Byrd rule prevents reconciliation from being used to make policy changes that don\\'t affect the deficit, which is the main goal of the fast-track procedure. \"We\\'re really just trying to game out all of the different options our members have to basically repeal in whole or in part,\" said one senior GOP Senate aide. \"We definitely are preparing to do only budgetary things.\"\\n\\nFive years after the fact, Republicans are learning yet again that slogans don\\'t actually equate with policy. They\\'re also figuring out that while it\\'s really easy to hold 55 symbolic votes to repeal Obamacare, making it actually happen isn\\'t so easy —never mind coming up with something to replace it with!That means lots of hard work. And it means trying to figure out what will save money instead of just costing—and because so many of the provisions actually raise significant amounts of revenue, it\\'s really complicated to try to tease out that balance. The simple idea of \"repeal,\" sold by people with simple minds to voters with simple minds just isn\\'t how it works in reality.\\n\\nBut they don\\'t have to work in reality! That\\'s because they have the \"fairy dust\" magic they created by imposing \"dynamic scoring\" on how the Congressional Budget Office figures out what stuff is going to cost. So they can at least make it all look like it could work, and on paper they can look like they\\'re doing real stuff. And they know they won\\'t have to suffer the consequences of it all blowing to hell, because a presidential veto will save them from that. So maybe this governing thing isn\\'t that hard, after all.

       " ('A column by Jonah Goldberg published in the dead-tree National Review (August 30) “A Muslim Gay Bar by the Mosque?” typifies the utterly infantile quality of our current movement conservative discourse. Goldberg writes in glowing defense of Fox News celebrity Greg Gutfeld, who had just advocated (presumably in a serious way) the creation of a Muslim gay bar in the vicinity of Ground Zero. Goldberg happily embraces this idea as a “tough-minded libertarian.” After all, freedom, he insists, “is a cultural institution that needs to be defended, even if that means offending people.” Moreover, “whatever you may think of gay bars, they’re not going away in the freedom-loving West. Pretty much everybody else in American life has learned how to live-and-let-live with such places to one extent or another.”\\n\\nOne might ask Goldberg, the “tough-minded libertarian,” why just one month earlier he had denounced Rand Paul in a column for raising hesitant objections to Provision Two of the Civil Rights Act, a provision that restricts an employer’s right to hire whom he wants for a job. According to Goldberg in one of the most ferocious tirades I’ve seen coming from his pen, unless the subject is the critics of Israel or “Obama fascism,” he let loose against the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate from Kentucky for “lamenting the lost right of bigots.”\\n\\nApparently the anti-discrimination mechanism created by Civil Rights Act of 1964 gave this country “economic freedom” for the first time, although it is not at all clear how it did so. But in any case why is my historic right to hire or accommodate whom I want in my business establishment less of a right than the right to run a gay bar, to the consternation of religious and moral traditionalists? Why should I have less of a right not to confer a job on a prospective employee than to scandalize devout Christians by establishing a sodomy recruiting agency in their neighborhood?\\n\\nWe all know the answer. Like his pals on FOX News and NR, Goldberg occasionally mimics a politically correct leftist even while working for GOP electoral victories. There is nothing noticeably rightwing about him or his chums, Rich Lowry, Glenn Beck, or the other movement conservatives who are working overtime trying to demonstrate their sensitivity to minorities and cultural liberals. Whether it is Glenn Beck quoting Martin Luther King and deploring the mildness of Reconstruction, Rich Lowry congratulating Abe Foxman and the ADL for taking a “courageous” position against building a mosque near Ground Zero or Laura Schlesinger ranting against the N-word, all of these personalities are as nauseatingly obsequious as they’re predictable. I’ve no idea why the only people who seem to notice this obvious fact are contributors to and readers of this website. Whenever I mention the same tics to white-bread Republicans or NR-subscribers, their response is to tell me they didn’t notice the offending behavior.\\n\\nAre movement conservatives who denounced Obama for bowing to the Emperor of Japan blind to the infinitely greater indignity committed by W, who apologized for slavery in West Africa in 2003? Why was there no “conservative” outcry similar to the one against Obama when a Republican insulted White Americans? Further: was Steve Sailer the only writer who noticed when FOX “conservative” Karl Rove pushed sub-prime rate loans for Hispanics before the financial crash at the end of Bush’s reign? One might think that conservatives would be up in arms over such an outrage.\\n\\nSomehow such facts never register when I bring them up to movement conservatives. My interlocutors prefer to go into a song and dance about Obama’s being bad news. They also insist that the people I complain about must be rightwing because the Left says so. And, equally important, FOX News describes them as “conservatives.” Moreover, these good folks have no choice but to butter up minorities and gays. Otherwise the Left would attack them even more vigorously than it does as racists, sexists, and homophobes. The question left begging is this: If the Left rushes to attack their mild opposition as politically incorrect, no matter how furiously Goldberg, Lowry, and Schlesinger suck up to PC victims, why do movement conservatives bother to grovel — to no avail? They might as well move to the right openly — or at least stop groveling. The reason they don’t is they themselves are captive to the Left psychologically and socially. These authorized opponents of the Left reflect what they intermittently claim to be against. In the media industry, cultural-social differences are far less significant than elsewhere in the country.\\n\\nAs a scholar it behooves me to mention some possible objection to my assertions. There are movement conservative critics, it might be argued, who, contrary to what I seem to be suggesting, have moved away from Goldberg, Ross Douthat, and David Frum by going after the gay lobby. Just about any issue of First Things would show the persistence of this other view. Also (and this too I may be missing) articles in mainstream movement conservative publications take critical stands against illegal immigration, more gay rights, and other recent demands of the social Left. Certainly the conservative movement does not uniformly resemble the establishment Left on every question relating to race, gender, lifestyle, and the war against discrimination.\\n\\nORDER IT NOW\\n\\nBut counter-objections could be raised to these arguments. One, most prominent movement conservative journalists and TV personalities associated with the Right behave very much like Lowry, Goldberg, etc. Beside feeling obliged to express joy over the civil rights revolutions for black, women and other minorities, these prominent conservatives are slavishly tied to the GOP. Fox News and NR stars have become tiresome adjuncts of that party. And movement conservative celebrities seem to be following the Bush-Rove strategy of throwing under the bus traditional conservative groups like Southern Whites in order to appeal to the civil rights lobby, AIPAC, and “moderate” minorities. Why bother worrying about insulting crackers, which Lowry did in a glaring manner when he described the alleged racist murder of Shirley Sherrod’s father as “demographically representative” of the South before the feds got into enforcing the civil rights revolution? The Southern whites will vote for the GOP no matter what.\\n\\nTwo, the morally traditionalist, predominantly Catholic wing of the conservative movement will be allowed to spin its wheels, as long as it doesn’t show too much independence. About twelve years ago, R.J. Neuhaus and others associated with First Things began talking about the moral decadence of the “American regime.” But the grousers were promptly disciplined by Decter, Himmelfarb, and other female custodians of the neocon hegemony. These ladies explained to the obstinate priest and his friends who it was who controlled their finances and access to the media. Almost immediately the complaints against the “regime” stopped.\\n\\nMoreover, it is permissible for conservative movement-affiliated traditionalists to go their own way on abortion, gay marriage, and a few other family issues, providing they swear fealty to their masters in other matters. To the latter belong such weighty things as backing neocon-promoted wars to spread liberal democracy and end “Islamofascism,” celebrating the triumphs of the civil rights movement and the canonization of Martin Luther King, and praising the American example of global, propositional democracy. Opponents of abortion treat their pro-life stand as an extension of the civil rights movement, and they counterfactually identify the pro-choice lobby as “anti-black.” (Of course blacks take the diametrically opposite position, as one learns from their predictable political choices.) The same traditionalists, typified by Michael Novak and Cal Thomas, enjoy attacking the Left as “anti-Semitic,” although this warning has certainly not affected Jews’ voting patterns. The traditionalist wing of the conservative movement pays a heavy price indeed for its limited right to expression under neocon surveillance. Catholic and other traditionalists are clearly not in the driver’s seat, and they can be effortlessly pushed off the bus or demeaned, the way NR treats unreconstructed Southerners.',\n",

Today I spoke with an 89-year-old World War II veteran. Both said the same thing to me. “It was hell, but I was proud to serve.”\\n\\nThe elder of the two entered the U.S. Marine Corps the day after Pearl Harbor, and fought in the Pacific theater of war “with the Squids.” The man I met today served in the U.S. Army, on the battlefields of Europe, from 1944-1945, and served a total of 12 years despite being shot in the tailbone during his time fighting Nazi Germany. Though he was still in the service during the Korean War, he remained stateside during that conflict.\\n\\n“I was young,” he said. So very, very young when I went to Europe. It was hell, but I was proud to serve. It was so horrible, I didn’t think I was going to make it home alive. They would even put poison in your food at restaurants, hoping to kill American soldiers before they could finish their meal and get back to their post.”\\n\\nHe described the terror of being shot at by machine guns, the bullets flipping up dust and rocks all around him, as he ran for his next momentary safety of cover. He didn’t think he was a good shot, but he fired his weapon carefully, making sure he didn’t waste his ammunition, and that he only fired when the odds were best to hit the enemy.\\n\\n“War is a horrible thing,” he told me, “but the enemy doesn’t care, so we have to fight. We have to fight to be free.”\\n\\nHe ventured to say that today’s politician doesn’t understand the resolve, or the deception that is employed, by the enemy. “The enemy has no remorse. They only want you dead. It is you, or them. So, you are supposed to fight. Today, the government wants us to stand in our place with our hands to our side to show the enemy that we are not a threat, giving the enemy a clear and easy shot to kill us. That is how they fight war today. They fight it by not fighting, and then when we are shot at, our President says we should feel guilty for being on the battlefield.”\\n\\nHis ball cap had a patch on it that read, “U.S. Army Veteran,” with Army pins all around the patch. One of the pins stood out. It wasn’t an Army pin, but one that was the most important to him on his cap. It was a cross, with the American Flag as a design.\\n\\n“I have one of those,” I said.\\n\\n“That is the main reason we are free,” he said. “The Blessings of God have always been on this country. Today, I am not so sure.”\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " ('A day after a Russian fighter allegedly flew within 5 feet of a US reconnaissance plane traveling over the Baltic Sea, Reuters reports that a NATO F-16 fighter jet returned the favor when it tried to improperly approach a plane carrying the Russian defense minister. The plane was traveling to the city of Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave along the Baltic coast, where Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu was scheduled to discuss security issues with defense officials on Wednesday. The NATO aircraft was warded off by a Russian Su-27 jet, according to RT.\\n\\nIn an accounting of the incident, Reuters notes that one of the Russian fighter jets escorting Shoigu\\'s plane had inserted itself between the defense minister\\'s plane and the NATO fighter and \"tilted its wings from side to side to show the weapons it was carrying, Russian agencies said.\" After that the F-16 promptly left the area.\\n\\nA clip of the encounter was caught on tape by Russian journalists:\\n\\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that he has no information about the incident.\\n\\n“It’s probably better to ask the Defense Ministry,” Peskov said in answer to journalists’ questions.\\n\\nThe latest provocative maneuver represents yet another escalation of tensions between the US and Russia. On Monday, Russia suspended cooperation with the US in Syria under the \"memorandum of incident prevention in Syrian skies\", warning that its missile defense would intercept any aircraft traveling in Russia’s area of operation after a US fighter jet shot down a Syrian regime aircraft on Sunday.\\n\\nRussia slammed the US for shooting down the jet, calling the attack an “act of aggression\" and claiming that the move benefited terrorists in the area. The Syrian regime says its jet was pursuing a fleeing ISIS convoy around the time it was shot down. US officials claimed they tried to contact its Russia counterparts via an established “de-confliction line,\" though Russia has denied this, saying that if the US had reached out, the incident could’ve been avoided.\\n\\nA US jet also downed a pro-regime drone on Monday in what Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy described as a “dangerous escalation\" of tensions between the US and pro-Syrian regime powers like Iran and Russia. “I think we’re getting closer and closer to open conflict between Iran and Russia and the American public need to know that we are moving very fast towards what could be another war in the Middle East – something Donald Trump promised he wouldn’t do when he ran for office.”\\n\\nAs RT notes, encounters between US and Russian warplanes over the Baltic are becoming more frequent. A Russian fighter jet intercepted a small group of US warplanes, including Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker military refueling aircraft, two B-1 bombers and one B-52, during a BALTOPS (Baltic Operations) annual training exercise on June 10.',\n",

The change could save New Yorkers millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of days of jail time, and follows a city, state and nationwide trend towards reforming the system of pre-trial justice.\\n\\nThis move puts New York City on the cutting edge when it comes to bail reform. So far, the only state to have adopted such a measure is New Jersey, though others may soon follow.\\n\\nNew Jersey made a similar move in 2016, and state legislatures in Missouri, Ohio, Alabama, California and Maryland are expected to debate legislation in early 2018 that would do the same. A bipartisan group of US senators have also discussed legislation to outlaw cash bail nationwide, but it has not gained much traction.\\n\\nFor context, the effect of moving toward release on recognizance in New York City alone is enormous.\\n\\nSome 40,000 New Yorkers could avoid a cumulative 680,000 days in jail annually, waiting for trial or save $40m in bail owed to buy their temporary freedom.\\n\\nOf course, jail isn’t free for the state or the person incarcerated, so the savings extend to more than just those who’d otherwise be subject to jail time in lieu of bail.',\n",

Reported Rasmussen: A survey of likely voters “finds that Bayh attracts support from just 44% or 45% of voters when matched against his top potential Republican challengers.”\\n\\nFor a well-known incumbent to fall below 50 percent in voter surveys is a real sign of political danger ahead, and Rasmussen concluded that Bayh would likely face “a tough reelection battle” in the fall.\\n\\nMeanwhile, there is real GOP pushback in Indiana to the Washington-blessed candidacy of former Sen. Dan Coats for the Bayh seat.\\n\\nWith reason.\\n\\nCNN reports that Democrats have unearthed a video showing Coats at his new home in North Carolina saying the Tar Heel state is “a better place” to live than Indiana. Critics also are combing through records from Coats recent work as a lobbyist, searching for clients who might lead to political embarrassment.\\n\\nHis two Republican challengers are hammering away at his voting record on Second Amendment issues that often play big in Hoosier state GOP primaries. Coats was one of only a handful of senate Republicans to vote for the Brady gun control bill.\\n\\nCoats chose to leave the Senate 12 years ago rather than face a challenge from the then politically popular Gov. Evan Bayh.\\n\\nThe GOP lost its strongest candidate for the Bayh seat when Rep. Mike Pence decided to forgo the senate race to continue on his path up the ladder of the House Republican leadership.\\n\\nBut the increasingly influential RedState blogger Erick Erickson came out today with a strong endorsement of state Sen. Marlin Stutzman, a young farmer has an impressive record in the Indiana legislature.\\n\\nWrites Erickson: “The GOP needs to change its public image that voters have. It should not be using retired Senators who moved out of the state and become a lobbyist to do that. We need younger faces and fresher voices. We needs guys like Marco Rubio. And we need guys like Marlin Stutzman.”\\n\\nErickson was one of the conservative leaders that produced a huge influx in campaign contributions for Conservative Doug Hoffman in NY-23.

       " ('A man named Devin, who has been in recovery from opioid addiction for more than a decade, shares what it was like to struggle with his disease. \"I was stealing from people, buying substances on the street, and I look back at that time with a lot of shame, you know, that’s not who I am ... Opioid use disorder is not a moral failing,\" he says in a government-funded ad campaign intended to curb opioid abuse.\\n\\nDevin now has a family, a master\\'s degree, and a career, and his story is part of an awareness campaign that aims to educate the public about the dangers of opioid abuse. Devin\\'s addiction began with a 30-day prescription from a doctor around the age of 16, following a procedure to remove his wisdom teeth.\\n\\nThe ad, among others, is part of an \"Rx Awareness\" pilot program that has been running since September in parts of Kentucky, Ohio, Massachusetts, and New Mexico that have high rates of addiction. The program, by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is set to run for 14 weeks as health officials evaluate if the ads are reaching the right audiences and how to boost messaging on those that are working.\\n\\nPresident Trump recently joined the effort by donating his third-quarter salary of $100,000 to build off the ad campaign. Creating an \"aggressive media campaign\" on the dangers of drugs and framing it as a disease rather than a moral failing is one of 56 recommendations laid out by the opioid commission he created, which is led by outgoing New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.\\n\\nThe larger ad campaign to come will be \"massive,\" Trump vowed as he delivered a speech in October directing his administration to declare the crisis a public health emergency.\\n\\nThe administration has not said how much it will spend on the larger campaign. The Trump administration has said Congress must appropriate funds for the opioid crisis but hasn\\'t put out a specific request or detailed which recommendations from the commission it plans to follow.\\n\\nThe pilot ads that have aired are different from the anti-drug messaging delivered to young people during the 1980s and 1990s. In those ads, teens were instructed to \"just say no\" to drugs and shown videos of an egg frying in a pan as a voice-over said, \"This is your brain on drugs.\" Studies have shown that the ads were not effective in changing behavior.\\n\\nThe message has evolved for approaching the opioid crisis, partly because many opioid addictions begin with a prescription from a doctor for painkillers such as oxycodone or hydrocodone. After patients become hooked, they turn to the drug\\'s cheaper street counterpart, heroin, which has increasingly been laced with fentanyl, a more potent opioid. As a result, more than 33,000 people in 2015 died from opioid-related overdoses, according to latest available data from the CDC.\\n\\nA Department of Health and Human Services official said other messages will remind people who take prescription painkillers to use them appropriately and will contain information about helping friends and families support people close to them who have addictions or have overdosed.\\n\\nThe other pilot program ads detail how a person\\'s addiction began with a prescription, how quickly they succumbed to addiction, and the losses that followed: a job, a home, or the death of a family member. Each video is accompanied with the message: \"Prescription opioids can be addictive and dangerous. It only takes a little to lose a lot,\" and then directs viewers to the CDC\\'s online campaign.\\n\\nEvidence about the effectiveness of public health campaigns is mixed. The opioid commission acknowledged that in its report, saying that even though awareness can be increased through ads, they aren\\'t always successful in changing behavior. Including information about where to receive treatment would be key, the commission concluded.\\n\\nA 2010 study in the Lancet, a medical journal, found that results varied according to the behavior being targeted and what kind of message was promoted. For instance, it found strong evidence that ads targeted at smoking changed behaviors, but that ads about alcohol showed little evidence of any benefit and ads on nutrition were more effective when they promoted healthy foods.\\n\\nThe Obama administration credited a $54 million anti-smoking campaign called \"Tips from Former Smokers\" with helping 100,000 people quit. The ads featured smokers discussing some of the side effects they faced, such as losing their voice boxes to cancer, having a high-risk pregnancy or losing teeth. HHS Acting Secretary Eric Hargan recently touted the CDC\\'s anti-smoking campaigns in a recent visit to the agency.\\n\\nAdvocates tend to agree that a mass media campaign, when done with accurate and helpful information, can be an effective part of prevention.\\n\\n\"We know ad campaigns work. That\\'s why the private sector uses them all the time,\" said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.\\n\\nHe adds that such advertising campaigns tend to be expensive. In 1998, the annual funding request for an anti-drug media campaign aimed at youths was $200 million a year, a sum that was doubled because it was matched by outside entities.\\n\\nThe money for such campaigns involves conducting studies on an audience, laying out which behaviors the agency is trying to change, doing trial runs and then tracking how effective the ads are, Benjamin said.\\n\\nHe stresses that the ad campaigns should be part of a broader strategy that involves access to treatment, regulatory changes, and tackling the black market. He acknowledged that several strategies have been implemented by different health agencies under the Trump administration, but said it would help to have a blueprint to know how the ad campaign would fit into a broader plan.\\n\\nDr. Corey Waller, chairman of the legislative advocacy committee for the American Society of Addiction Medicine, agreed.\\n\\n\"There are \\'things\\' going on,\" he said, specifically using quotation marks. \"The problem is I’m not able to see a coordinated, concerted effort to build the addiction ecosystem that we need.\"\\n\\nTrump\\'s comments on the topic have been mixed. Solving the crisis would \"require us to address the crisis in all of its very real complexity,\" the president said in his Oct. 26 speech declaring the opioid crisis a public health emergency. He also, however, stressed the need to have children avoid using drugs in the first place. He drew on his own experience avoiding tobacco and alcohol because his brother Fred died from alcoholism.\\n\\n\"The fact is, if we can teach young people, and people generally, not to start, it\\'s really, really easy not to take them,\" Trump said.\\n\\nThat portion of the speech drew criticism from those who likened it to the \"just say no\" anti-drug campaigns during the 1980s, such as the Drug Policy Alliance, which opposes the way the U.S. has pursued anti-drug policies that have stressed criminalization and resulted in massive incarceration.\\n\\nThe opioid commission pushed back on such characterizations.\\n\\n“The commission, through its report, made clear that opioid addiction is a complex issue with many factors, including the fact that many people start with an opioid prescription for legitimate medical use,\" said Brian Murray, press secretary for Christie. \"The recommendations speak for themselves in regards to messages that can be delivered to the public. If anyone thought that saying \\'just say no\\' were the solution, there would not have been a commission formed or a resulting 100-plus page report delivered with specific suggestions on combatting this crisis.”\\n\\nThe commission recommended a similar campaign to the one issued during the AIDS epidemic, which sent a mass mailer to U.S. households to educate the public about how the virus was spread. It also cited a Food and Drug Administration anti-smoking campaign called \"The Real Cost\" as an example to emulate.\\n\\nWaller said that if the administration \"puts all its eggs in one basket,\" it could go a long way toward reducing stigma about addiction.\\n\\n\"The biggest area is in decreasing stigma ... that this is a chronic brain disorder and not bad decision-making,\" he said. \"I think we have to continue that.\"\\n\\n• Correction: The duration of the opioid campaign has been corrected. It will run 14 weeks.',\n",

       " ('A month after San Diego began street-bleaching in an effort to control its spread, Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency as California\\'s Hepatitis A outbreak has \"gone statewide,\" with dozens dead and hundreds hospitalized.\\n\\nIn order to combat the disease, the southern California city of San Diego has literally begun spraying the streets with bleach.\\n\\nAn article by NPR said that the Hepatitis A was first identified in the area in early March, according to the county, and declared a public health emergency earlier this month. Nearly 400 people have been infected with the disease.\\n\\nThe majority of those sickened by this viral infection outbreak have been homeless people. A letter from San Diego County health officials stated that hepatitis A is being spread through contact with a “fecally contaminated environment” as well as person-to-person transmission. A big part of the problem is an apparent lack of public restrooms in areas where the homeless population congregates.\\n\\nHepatitis A is a highly contagious viral infection, which can prove fatal. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the virus attacks the liver. Adequate personal hygiene and sanitation can help prevent the spread of the virus.\\n\\nBut, as we pointed out earlier this week, the hepatitis A outbreak that started in San Diego is now on the verge of reaching statewide epidemic status, as cases have spread through homeless tent cities all the way north to Sacramento.\\n\\nAt least 569 people have been infected and 17 have died of the virus since November in San Diego, Santa Cruz and Los Angeles counties, where local outbreaks have been declared. Dr. Monique Foster, a medical epidemiologist with the Division of Viral Hepatitis at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters Thursday that California’s outbreak could linger even with the right prevention efforts. “It’s not unusual for them to last quite some time — usually over a year, one to two years,” Foster said.\\n\\nCalifornia’s outbreak of hepatitis A could continue for many months, even years, health officials said Thursday.\\n\\nAs ABC7.com reports, California is experiencing the largest hepatitis A outbreak in the United States transmitted from person to person - instead of by contaminated food - since the vaccine became available in 1996.\\n\\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Public Health declared a local outbreak of hepatitis A in September. San Diego and Santa Cruz have also declared local outbreaks. According to the CDPH, there have been a total of 18 deaths so far - all in the San Diego area, which has reported 490 cases of hepatitis A and 342 hospitalizations. The CDPH said the Santa Cruz area has 71 reported cases and 33 hospitalizations; Los Angeles has 8 reported cases and 6 hospitalizations; and other regions in California have 7 reported cases and 5 hospitalizations. This brings the total number of cases in the state to 576 with 386 hospitalizations.\\n\\nThis has prompted Gov. Jerry Brown to declare a state of emergency ...\\n\\nThe emergency proclamation, which was issued by Brown on Friday, allows the state to increase its supply of hepatitis A vaccines in order to control the current outbreak. Immunizations from the federal vaccine program have been distributed to at-risk populations in affected areas, but additional supplies are needed, according to a statement released by Brown\\'s office. The emergency proclamation gives the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) authority to immediately purchase vaccines directly from manufacturers and distribute them to impacted communities.\\n\\nHepatitis A is commonly transmitted through contaminated food. The only outbreak in the last 20 years bigger than California’s occurred in Pennsylvania in 2003, when more than 900 people were infected after eating contaminated green onions at a restaurant.\\n\\nCalifornia’s outbreak, however, is spreading from person to person, mostly among the homeless community...\\n\\n“There’s syringes, there’s human feces, there are dead animals, rats alive, and dead rats … pee bottles, five-gallon buckets used as toilets,” “We’re definitely concerned about this added threat of hepatitis A.”\\n\\nAs Breitbart points out, California\\'s tent cities are the direct result of \"proactive\" legislation that forbids police from dispersing homeless people living in tent cities between the hours of 9pm and 5:30am.\\n\\nCalifornia homeless advocates have been successful across the state in forcing cities to accept the homeless living in large tent communities on public property. The advocates refer to anti-homeless ordinances as the modern-day equivalent to post-slavery Jim Crow and Depression era anti-Okie laws that allowed police to disperse people deemed “undesirable” after dark. The City of San Diego was forced to sign the Spencer Settlement in 2006, which forbids its Police Department from enforcing the city’s “Illegal Lodging Enforcement Guidelines” between the hours of 9 pm to 5:30 am. California, with 115,738 homeless, now accounts for about 21 percent of America’s total homeless population. Due to legal settlements against vagrancy laws, about 72.3 percent of California’s homeless are unsheltered, usually living in tent cities.\\n\\nIf you like your socialist utopia, you can keep your socialist utopia.',\n",

The Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia is Sheik Abdul Aziz al ash-Shaikh, 72, the equivalent of the Catholic Church’s pope. He’s been blind since 1960.\\n\\nThe blind Grand Mufti has just declared it necessary to destroy all Christian churches in the Middle East region. In so doing, Sheik Abdul puts the lie to Muslims’ insistence that Islam’s God is the same as the God of Judaism and Christianity, and that Muslims respect Jews and Christians as all “People of the Book.”\\n\\nAs reported by an editorial in The Washington Times on March 16, 2012:\\n\\nOn March 12, Sheik Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah, the grand mufti of Saudi Arabia, declared that it is “necessary to destroy all the churches of the region.” The ruling came in response to a query from a Kuwaiti delegation over proposed legislation to prevent construction of churches in the emirate. The mufti based his decision on a story that on his deathbed, Muhammad declared, “There are not to be two religions in the [Arabian] Peninsula.” This passage has long been used to justify intolerance in the kingdom. Churches have always been banned in Saudi Arabia, and until recently Jews were not even allowed in the country. Those wishing to worship in the manner of their choosing must do so hidden away in private, and even then the morality police have been known to show up unexpectedly and halt proceedings.\\n\\nThis is not a small-time radical imam trying to stir up his followers with fiery hate speech. This was a considered, deliberate and specific ruling from one of the most important leaders in the Muslim world. It does not just create a religious obligation for those over whom the mufti has direct authority; it is also a signal to others in the Muslim world that destroying churches is not only permitted but mandatory.\\n\\nBeing not just a mufti but a grand mufti, the sheik’s declaration that it is “necessary to destroy all the churches of the region,” therefore is a fatwa — a juristic ruling concerning Islamic law.\\n\\nNot only is the sheik’s declaration unreported by the useless MSM, the fatwa also went without any comment, even less a condemnation, by the Obama administration.\\n\\nThe Washington Times notes:\\n\\nIf the pope called for the destruction of all the mosques in Europe, the uproar would be cataclysmic. Pundits would lambaste the church, the White House would rush out a statement of deep concern, and rioters in the Middle East would kill each other in their grief. But when the most influential leader in the Muslim world issues a fatwa to destroy Christian churches, the silence is deafening. […]\\n\\nThe Obama administration ignores these types of provocations at its peril. The White House has placed international outreach to Muslims at the center of its foreign policy in an effort to promote the image of the United States as an Islam-friendly nation. This cannot come at the expense of standing up for the human rights and religious liberties of minority groups in the Middle East. The region is a crucial crossroads. Islamist radicals are leading the rising political tide against the authoritarian, secularist old order. They are testing the waters in their relationship with the outside world, looking for signals of how far they can go in imposing their radical vision of a Shariah-based theocracy. Ignoring provocative statements like the mufti’s sends a signal to these groups that they can engage in the same sort of bigotry and anti-Christian violence with no consequences.\\n\\nMr. Obama’s outreach campaign to the Muslim world has failed to generate the good will that he expected. In part, this was because he felt it was better to pander to prejudice than to command respect. When members of the Islamic establishment call for the religious equivalent of ethnic cleansing, the leader of the free world must respond or risk legitimizing the oppression that follows. The United States should not bow to the extremist dictates of the grand mufti, no matter how desperate the White House is for him to like us.\\n\\nAlas, The Washington Times’ counsel that Obama should condemn what the Saudi Grand Mufti said will fall on deaf ears. Have we already forgotten this famous bow to the Saudi king in 2009?\\n\\nThankfully, since Islam is not (yet) a unified political religion, but is divided at least into the Sunni and Shia sects, dissenting Muslim voices are already criticizing the Grand Mufti’s call to “destroy all the churches” in the Gulf region.\\n\\nTurkey’s top imam, Mehmet Görmez, said he cannot accept the Grand Mufti’s fatwa because it runs contrary to the centuries-old Islamic teachings of tolerance and the sanctity of institutions belonging to other religions.\\n\\nH/t our beloved fellow Grouchy.\\n\\n~Eowyn\\n\\nAdvertisements',\n",

Was that the duty we had signed up for, the reason we spent so much time away from our families?”\\n\\nByrne served in federal law enforcement for nearly 30 years — the U.S. Air Force Security Police, the Uniformed Division of the Secret Service, and most recently as a Federal Air Marshal. In his first book, the No. 1 New York Times best-seller Crisis of Character, he shared his experiences as the first Secret Service employee compelled to testify in a criminal case against a sitting U.S. president.\\n\\nHis new book is a behind-the-scenes look at how the Secret Service operates.\\n\\nDuring the Clinton years, the agency faced an initial crisis when the new president wanted his Arkansas State Police to help protect him, and then, failing that, wanted the Secret Service to play along with him like his home state police.\\n\\nByrne reports that the Secret Service did give in, but only so far.\\n\\nFor example, when Clinton tried to sneak out alone in a car driven by a longtime aide, the Uniformed Division officer at the front gate wouldn’t open it, and asked for backup.\\n\\nByrne quotes the unnamed officer’s call for help: “You better get me some help up here. I just caught Bruce Lindsey trying to drive out West Exec. with the president with a raincoat over his head.”\\n\\nHe also said that the service was angered with Clinton’s antics and efforts to skip out unnoticed. But in the end, they agreed to “off the record” trips in small motorcades, wrote Byrne.\\n\\n\"If the president could not completely duck his detail, he would at least take them ‘off the record,’ or OTR. Sometimes this was done for highly honorable reasons, such as when President Clinton, without fanfare, along with many other top military leadership, visited the grieving widow of a fallen high-ranking military official. But the freedom of OTRs under this president was soon to be abused and, in one instance, nearly cost an officer his life. President Clinton used the OTRs to visit the well-known and lesser-known mistresses he frequented outside the complex, meaning the ones who did not have access to the White House,” wrote Byrne, without mentioning Lewinsky, a Clinton intern.\\n\\nIt was on one of those OTRs that the accident with “Reverend” occurred, he wrote.\\n\\n“Due to the haphazard, improvised, and extremely dangerous way the motorcade was operating, the tail car was T-boned by a civilian car correctly crossing the intersection at a green light. It wasn’t that Reverend’s car just missed the red light. But many of the cars in front of him had missed the light as well, and he had simply followed through. The car that hit him had not been stopped and waiting at the intersection; the civilian driving it had accelerated to full speed from a significant distance away. For the civilians, the light had long been green. Reverend was severely injured, as were another officer and two civilians. The convoy continued on. Metro PD was alerted, and that’s when it learned that the Secret Service had been operating throughout D.C. in such a dangerous fashion,” he wrote.\\n\\nByrne added, “Reverend was hospitalized with a severe traumatic brain injury. It was significant enough that he was pulled from duty pending his recovery and even then would return only on ‘light duty’ status. In an unfortunate mix-up and evidence of the Secret Service’s horrible management.”\\n\\nHe also offered an anecdote about how Clinton would take his wedding ring off when on his OTRs:\\n\\n“Another tale that was kept from the public would have surely been called ‘Ringgate’ had the media caught wind of it. The president was in a major metropolitan airport, en route to Air Force One, when he realized he had left his wedding ring at his hotel. He ordered the motorcade to turn around so he could retrieve it. He was especially concerned about being seen arriving or boarding without his wedding ring as he had been traveling without the first lady.\"\\n\\nPaul Bedard, the Washington Examiner\\'s \"Washington Secrets\" columnist, can be contacted at pbedard@washingtonexaminer.com',\n",

       " (\"A new poll shows Republican Monica Wehby leading incumbent Democrat Jeff Merkley for the first time in the race for U.S. Senate in Oregon. The poll, conducted for the Daily Caller by Vox Populi Polling, asked registered voters who they are supporting in the race, with 40 percent saying they'd support Wehby, a pediatric neurosurgeon and first-time candidate, and another 5 percent saying they are leaning toward voting for her. Merkley, on the other hand, received 39 percent support with 2 percent saying they are leaning toward voting toward him. With those numbers combined, Wehby leads Merkley 45 percent to 41 percent.\\n\\nHere's more from the Caller:\\n\\nAccording to Vox Populi’s Brent Seaborn, the poll shows that “the Senate race in Oregon is very much in play for Republicans.” The poll also indicates that a plurality of voters in the deep-blue state see Obamacare as a mostly failed venture. Forty-six percent of respondents said Obamacare and Cover Oregon, the state’s disastrously flawed health care exchange, were failures, while 17 percent said they were successes, and 37 percent said they were “somewhere in between.”\\n\\nRead the full poll results here.\\n\\nAre the poll's findings believable? Maybe, though at this point it's an outlier, not part of a discernible trend. Merkley, who was first elected in 2008 after narrowly defeating Republican incumbent Gordon Smith, has had weak poll numbers since the beginning of the year. But Oregon remains a deeply Democratic state. Barack Obama defeated Mitt Romney there by 12 points, and Democrats hold the governor's mansion, both U.S. Senate seats, 4 of its 5 House seats, and both houses of the state legislature.\\n\\nFurthermore, Wehby doesn't exactly have the GOP nomination locked up. Her opponent in the May 20 primary is state senator Jason Conger, and while Wehby is much better funded and has the backing of much of the Republican establishment (from a new super PAC to Mitt Romney), she is considered more moderate than Conger and perhaps the GOP primary base. All that seems to explain why she has the support of the establishment, though one poll found Conger performing better than Wehby in the general election against Merkley.\\n\\nAnd Wehby may be hurting herself in the final weeks of the GOP primary by deciding not to participate in the only televised debate with Conger. The Oregonian, whose editorial board endorsed her in the primary, nonetheless has a scathing criticism of Wehby's decision:\\n\\nWehby should reconsider, and fast. Wimping out in this fashion will simply call attention to her one significant weakness as a candidate, which is a lack of legislative experience that might make her seem unprepared for elective office. Wehby has a lot to offer, which is why we endorsed her, but a capable candidate in her position should seize opportunities to prove herself to voters, not run from them. If Wehby doesn’t change course, Republicans should hold onto their ballots and listen to the City Club debate. She does not deserve a free pass.\\n\\nThe Daily Caller poll did not survey voters about Conger or the primary.\",\n",

It may not be too surprising that the feds have Mission Impossible-esque gear to get information, but what’s especially chilling is that local police departments are increasingly gaining access and using these tools — often to violate our civil rights.\\n\\nBut domestically the devices have been used in a way that violates the constitutional rights of citizens, including the Fourth Amendment prohibition on illegal search and seizure, critics like Lynch say. They have regularly been used without warrants, or with warrants that critics call overly broad. Judges and civil liberties groups alike have complained that the devices are used without full disclosure of how they work, even within court proceedings. ... The controversy around cellphone surveillance illustrates the friction that comes with redeploying military combat gear into civilian life. The U.S. government has been using cell-site simulators for at least 20 years, but their use by local law enforcement is a more recent development\\n\\nAnd with Trump presenting himself as “law and order” president who hates the “unfair” “anti-police” sentiment, departments will likely have free reign in using these technologies.

Mark Rasch is the former DOJ cybercrimes prosecutor who claims to be Project Vigilant’s General Counsel and who says he made key connections with the government on Manning.\\n\\nMind you, the multiple versions of Uber’s story of his involvement in turning in Manning are inconsistent. At least a couple versions have Lamo calling Uber in June, after Manning had already been arrested.\\n\\nSo there are plenty of reasons to doubt the Lamo and Uber story. And security insiders have suggested the whole Project Vigilant story may be nothing more than a publicity stunt.\\n\\nFurthermore, this email may be more of the same. Uber may have been doing no more than cold-calling Hoglund just as he was making a big publicity push capitalizing on the Manning arrest.\\n\\nBut consider this.\\n\\nLamo’s conversations with Manning have always looked more like the coached questions of someone trying to elicit already-suspected details than the mutual boasting of two hackers. Because of that and because of the inconsistencies and flimsiness of the Project Vigilant story, PV all looked more like a cover story for why Lamo would narc out Bradley Manning than an accurate story. And Uber’s email here and his DefCon press conference may well be publicity stunts. But then, that’s what Aaron Barr’s research on Anonymous was supposed to be: a widely publicized talk designed to bring new business. But a key part of the PV story was the claim that Adrian Lamo had volunteered with the group working on “adversary characterization.”\\n\\nUber says Lamo worked as a volunteer research associate for Project Vigilant for about a year on something called adversary characterization, which involved gathering information for a project on devising ways to attribute computer intrusions to individuals or groups. He helped define the roles, tools and methods intruders would use to conduct such attacks.\\n\\nWhile it is described as more technical, that’s not all that different from what Aaron Barr was doing with social media on Anonymous.\\n\\nOne more thing. Consider what DOJ has been doing since the time Lamo turned in Manning and now: asking social media providers for detailed information about a network of people associated with Wikileaks. That is, DOJ appears to have been doing with additional legal tools precisely what Barr was doing with public sources.\\n\\nThat’s likely all a big coinkydink. But these security hackers all seem to love turning their freelance investigations into big publicity stunts.',\n",

The National BSA Council has reached out to WDW to try to resolve the situation, however, according to WDW, their views do not currently align with the BSA and they are choosing to discontinue this level of support. We will continue to keep an open line of communication with them, but at this time, are unable to reverse their decision.”\\n\\nBlah. Blah. Blah.\\n\\nEvery year, tens of thousands of LGBT people gather on the first weekend in June at Walt Disney World and other Orlando theme parks and resorts, making it one of the biggest LGBT group celebrations in the world. Disney does not officially recognize the “Gay Day,” but has not discouraged the tradition, which has earned it the wrath of conservative and religious groups. It also has offered health benefits to same-sex partners of employees since 1995, and allows same-sex marriage ceremonies on its grounds.\\n\\nDisney World either doesn’t know or, more likely, doesn’t care that:\\n\\nCaptain William Riddle of the Los Angeles Police says, “30,000 sexually abused children in Los Angeles were victims of homosexuals.” (Source: Kaifetz, J. “Homosexual Rights Are Concern for Some,” Post-Tribune , 18 December 1992.).\\n\\n, 18 December 1992.). 33% of homosexuals ADMIT to minor/adult sex.

       " ('A scene from the Gay Pride Parade in Miami Beach, FL, April 14, 2013 (Source).\\n\\nMost of this post was first published two years ago as “What They’ll Never Tell You in ‘Homosexual Education’.” I’m re-publishing it, given:\\n\\nLast week’s momentous Supreme Court decision against the federal DOMA (Defense of Marriage Act) law, which opens the floodgates to homosexual marriage across the United States. (See “ Supreme Court rules for homosexual marriage\\n\\nThe myth we’re being told that “gay” marriage is all about “love.” In fact, as lesbian activist Masha Gessen openly admitted what supporters of traditional marriage have long suspected, the push for gay marriage is about diminishing and eventually destroying the institution of marriage and redefining the traditional family. (See her on video, here .)\\n\\nA word of warning:\\n\\nWhen I first found out the information I’m about to relay to you, I was shocked and sick to my stomach. I kept the post in draft form for months, unable to bring myself to complete it. The great Scottish philosopher David Hume defined “evil” without resorting to theology: Evil is what causes harm or injury to oneself or to another. By that definition, the homosexual behaviors described below are evil.\\n\\nAre you ready?\\n\\nTake a deep breath. Here we go….\\n\\nIn his article, “The Health Risks of Gay Sex,” medical doctor John R. Diggs, Jr. writes that “The current media portrayal of gay and lesbian relationships is that they are as healthy, stable and loving as heterosexual marriages — or even more so. Medical associations are promoting somewhat similar messages.” But that portrayal is not consistent with facts.\\n\\nDr. Diggs warns that the consequences of homosexual sexual activity are distinct from the consequences of heterosexual activity. Just as it is his duty as a physician to recommend behaviors that are beneficial to our health and wellbeing, likewise it is his duty to inform patients of the health risks of gay sex — “Sexual relationships between members of the same sex expose gays, lesbians and bisexuals to extreme risks of Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs), physical injuries, mental disorders and even a shortened life span.”\\n\\nThere are at least 5 major areas of differences between gay and heterosexual relationships, each with specific medical consequences. Those differences include:\\n\\nLevels of promiscuity Physical health Mental health Life span Definition of “monogamy”\\n\\n1. Promiscuity\\n\\nThe “extreme” health risks of homosexual sex are a direct consequence of sexual promiscuity. Simply put, homosexuals are more promiscuous than heterosexuals. Prior to the AIDS epidemic, a 1978 study found that:\\n\\n75% of white gay males (3 of every 4) claimed to have had more than 100 lifetime male sex partners;\\n\\nof white gay males (3 of every 4) claimed to have had lifetime male sex partners; 15% claimed 100-249 sex partners;\\n\\n17% claimed 250-499;\\n\\n15% claimed 500- 999;\\n\\n28% (that’s more than 1 of every 5 white gay men!) claimed more than 1,000 lifetime male sex partners .\\n\\nLevels of promiscuity subsequently declined but, with the advent of AIDS drugs, they are again approaching those of the 1970s. From 1994 to 1997, the percentage of homosexual men reporting multiple partners and unprotected anal sex rose from 23.6% to 33.3%, with the largest increase among men under 25. The medical consequence of this promiscuity is that gays have a greatly increased likelihood of contracting HIV/AIDS, syphilis and other STDs.\\n\\nWhile similarly high rates of promiscuity have not been documented among lesbians, an Australian study did find lesbians to be more promiscuous than straight women:\\n\\n93% of lesbians reported having had sex with men. Other studies similarly show that 75-90% of women who have sex with women have also had sex with men.\\n\\nOther studies similarly show that 75-90% of women who have sex with women have also had sex with men. Lesbians were 4.5 times more likely than heterosexual women (9% of lesbians vs. 2% of heterosexual women) to have had more than 50 lifetime male sex partners.\\n\\n(9% of lesbians vs. 2% of heterosexual women) In addition to diseases that may be transmitted during lesbian sex, a study at an Australian STD clinic found that lesbians were 3 to 4 times more likely than heterosexual women to have sex with men who were high-risk for HIV.\\n\\nIt goes without saying that any degree of sexual promiscuity carries the risk of contracting STDs.\\n\\n2. Physical Health\\n\\nExcessive sexual promiscuity and certain common sexual practices among gay men result in epidemics like AIDS and serious medical consequences, some of which are virtually unknown among heterosexuals. A British researcher summarizes the danger as follows:\\n\\n“penile-anal, mouth-penile, and hand-anal sexual contact is usual for both [male homosexual] partners, and mouth-anal contact is not infrequent…. Mouth-anal contact is the reason for the relatively high incidence of diseases caused by bowel pathogens in male homosexuals. Trauma may encourage the entry of micro-organisms and thus lead to primary syphilitic lesions occurring in the anogenital area…. In addition to sodomy, trauma may be caused by foreign bodies, including stimulators of various kinds, penile adornments, and prostheses.”\\n\\na. Anal intercourse:\\n\\nBeginning in the “gay” culture, anal sex has now been “popularized” among heterosexuals via systematic propaganda of pornography.\\n\\nBut the simple truth is this: The human body was not designed to accommodate anal intercourse.\\n\\nThe rectum is significantly different from the vagina with regard to suitability for penetration by a penis. The vagina has natural lubricants and is composed of a mucus membrane with a multi-layer stratified squamous epithelium that allows it to endure friction without damage and to resist the immunological actions caused by semen and sperm. In contrast, the anus is a delicate mechanism of small muscles that comprise an “exit-only” passage. With repeated trauma, friction and stretching, the sphincter loses its tone and its ability to maintain a tight seal. Consequently, anal intercourse leads to leakage of fecal material that can easily become chronic. Moreover, the intestine has only a single layer of cells separating it from blood. Therefore, any organisms that are introduced into the rectum have a much easier time establishing a foothold for infection than they would in a vagina. The single layer tissue cannot withstand the friction associated with penile penetration, resulting in traumas that expose both participants to blood, organisms in feces, and a mixing of bodily fluids.\\n\\nFurthermore, ejaculate has components that are immunosuppressive, designed to allow the sperm to evade the immune defenses of the female. The fragility of the anus and rectum, along with the immunosuppressive effect of ejaculate, make anal-genital intercourse a most efficient manner of transmitting HIV and other infections. Below is a list of diseases found with extraordinary frequency among male homosexual practitioners as a result of anal intercourse. Sexual transmission of some of these diseases is so rare in the exclusively heterosexual population as to be virtually unknown. Lesbians are also at higher risk for these STDs:\\n\\nAnal cancer\\n\\nChlamydia trachomatis\\n\\nCryptosporidium\\n\\nGiardia lamblia\\n\\nHerpes simplex virus\\n\\nHuman immunodeficiency virus\\n\\nHuman papilloma virus\\n\\nIsospora belli\\n\\nMicrosporidia\\n\\nGonorrhea\\n\\nViral hepatitis types B & C\\n\\nSyphilis: gay men contracted syphilis at 3 to 4 times the rate of heterosexuals.\\n\\nHIV/AIDS : A study based upon statistics from 1986 through 1990 estimated that 20-year-old gay men had a 50% chance of becoming HIV positive by age 55. As of June 2001, nearly 64% of men with AIDS were men who have had sex with men.\\n\\nb. Oral-anal contact (aka “rimming”):\\n\\nIt is because of “rimming” that intestinal parasites ordinarily found in the tropics are encountered in the bodies of American gay men. An extremely high rate of parasitic and other intestinal infections is documented among male homosexual practitioners because of oral-anal contact. There are so many infections that a syndrome called “the Gay Bowel” is described in the medical literature. Gay bowel syndrome includes such diseases as Hepatitis A, Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica,Epstein-Barr virus,Neisseria meningitides,Shigellosis, Salmonellosis, Pediculosis, scabies, Campylobacter, and typhoid.\\n\\nc. Human Waste\\n\\nSome gay men engage in coprophilia, which means sexual contact with (including ingesting) highly infectious fecal wastes. This practice exposes the participants to all of the risks of anal-oral contact and many of the risks of analgenital contact.\\n\\nd. Fisting\\n\\n“Fisting” refers to the insertion of a hand or forearm into the rectum, and is far more damaging than anal intercourse. Tears can occur, along with incompetence of the anal sphincter. The result can include infections, inflammation and, consequently, enhanced susceptibility to future STDs. 22% of homosexuals (nearly 1 of every 4) in one survey admitted to having participated in this practice.\\n\\nAl Pacino and director William Friedkin got a lot of flak from “gay rights” activists for showing the truth in the 1980 movie Cruising, about an undercover cop investigating a serial killer who targets gay men, especially those involved in the S&M “culture.” One of the scenes in the movie was of a man in a gay bar smearing talcum powder on his right fist and wrist, followed by another man being fisted. If this isn’t evil, I truly don’t know what is.\\n\\ne. Sadism\\n\\nSadism is the sexualization of pain and cruelty, named for the 18th Century novelist, the Marquis de Sade. The medical consequences of such activities range from mild to fatal, depending upon the nature of the injuries inflicted. As many as 37% of homosexuals (more than 1 of every 3) have practiced some form of sadism.\\n\\n3. Mental Health\\n\\nMultiple studies have identified high rates of psychiatric illness, including depression, drug abuse and suicide attempts, among selfprofessed gays and lesbians. Gay activists argue that mental illness is induced by other people’s homophobia and intolerance.\\n\\nBut that argument is undermined by an extensive study in the Netherlands — a country of legalized same-sex marriages where GLBTs are widely accepted.The Dutch study, published in the Archives of General Psychiatry, found a high rate of psychiatric disease associated with same-sex sex. Gay men were much more likely to experience major depression, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Lesbians were more often diagnosed with major depression, social phobia or alcohol dependence. The researchers found “that homosexuality is not only associated with mental health problems during adolescence and early adulthood…but also in later life.”\\n\\nDepression and drug abuse, in turn, can lead to reckless sexual behavior, even among those who understand the deadly risks, such as older professional gay men.\\n\\n4. Life Span\\n\\nThe only epidemiological study (from Vancouver, Canada) to date on the life span of gay men concluded that gay and bisexual men lose up to 20 years of life expectancy. Compare that to cigarette smokers, who lose on average about 13.5 years of life expectancy. The Canadian study concluded that the probability of a 20-year-old gay or bisexual man living to 65 years was only 32%, compared to 78% for men in general.\\n\\n5. Monogamy\\n\\nMonogamy means long-term sexual fidelity. The most extensive survey of sex in America found that a vast majority of heterosexual committed couples are faithful: 94% of married people and 75% of cohabiting people had only one partner in the prior year.But long-term sexual fidelity is rare among GLB (gay, lesbian, bisexual) couples, particularly among gay males. Even during the coupling period, many gay men do not expect monogamy. One study reported that 66% of gay couples reported sex outside the relationship within the first year, and nearly 90% if the relationship lasted 5 years.\\n\\nThe average gay or lesbian relationship is also short lived. In one study, only 15% of gay men and 17.3% of lesbians had relationships that lasted more than 3 years. In other words, whatever data we have show very little long-term monogamy in GLB relationships, which then raises the question of why homosexuals are so insistent on their “unions” being legalized as marriages.\\n\\nTo read Dr. Diggs’ article in detail, go here.

Despite hitting a price of over $13,000 traders say that Bitcoin is booming as it is the strongest alternative.\\n\\nCollapse of banking\\n\\nZimbabwe is beginning to act like an interesting case study for what happens when a country begins to collapse around its monetary system - it is also being witnessed in Venezuela.\\n\\nMoving money out of Zimbabwe is starting to become impossible, and as people try and flee monetarily out of the crumbling state, they are finding refuge in Bitcoin.\\n\\nSoon, banks in Zimbabwe have stated that Visa debit cards would no longer be usable for international payments without prior arrangements and pre-funding with hard currency.\\n\\n“You will be required to make prior limit arrangements with the bank,” Stanbic said in a message to depositors last week.\\n\\nEconet Wireless has also stopped foreign payments on its MasterCard linked EcoCash mobile money debit card.\\n\\nBitcoin as a refuge\\n\\nBecause of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin, there is no impact on it from this political upheaval, in fact, it is only benefiting from it. The Bitcoin premium of almost 100 percent is not because of the political issues, rather the high demand surrounding worry of collapse.\\n\\nBitcoin again shows its potential and power when the banking system again shows its potential for mass collapse and hysteria.',\n",

       " ('A team of scientists in the UK set out a while back to figure out just what the most harmful drug in the world truly is and their conclusion may come as a bit shocking for most. What do you think the most dangerous drug in the world is?\\n\\nTheir research included carrying out an investigation to discover just how much harm was caused by 25 specific different drugs. In order to do this, they had to used 16 different parameters. Those included things like forms of physical, social, psychological harm, the risk of dependency, mental impairment, and more. Through these different things they were able to determine how much harm was being done and level the drugs out from least to most.\\n\\nThings like LSD and magic mushrooms proved to be the least harmful whereas heroin was found to be the most harmful because of the terrible withdrawal symptoms and numerous health issues, to say the least. Right below heroin was crack cocaine and the list goes on and on. That being said, heroin while most harmful was not found to be the most dangerous. The most dangerous drug in the world was found to be alcohol.\\n\\nIFLScience reported the following in regards to this finding:\\n\\nRegardless, the conclusion seems to be that alcohol is the most dangerous drug around. It directly causes a plethora of diseases, from cardiovascular and neurological disorders to liver degeneration; it indirectly causes transportation accidents, increases promiscuous activities and thus the likelihood of becoming infected by a range of pathogens, and makes an enormous dent in a nation’s economy as it pays for treatment for those suffering from alcohol-related problems.\\n\\nAsking the question “what is the world’s most dangerous drug” is fraught with complex political and social history – and many people believe all illegal drugs to be far more dangerous than legal ones. The legal status of various drugs is somewhat arbitrary, defined long ago in many Western nations by quirks of history.\\n\\nThis is because of it’s wide use and just how many people do really die from it worldwide. I mean, it literally kills one person every ten seconds. Did you guess right? Sure, there are some pretty terrible drugs out there but the one that happens to be most dangerous is sitting on a shelf at Walmart ready for you to consume.',\n",

       " ('A trio of liberal economists made the mistake of doing a study on how American workers spent their working hours. Their purpose was to find evidence of racial discrimination which would explain a racial gap in pay. To their dismay, however, the economists found significant racial differences in how much time Americans spent not working while on the job, i.e., how hard one works.\\n\\nThe economists are:\\n\\nDaniel Hamermesh , Professor of Economics, University of London. Katie Genadek , Research Scientist, University of Minnesota. Michael Burda , Professor Economics, Humbodlt University of Berlin.\\n\\nThe study was published as a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper titled, “Racial/Ethnic Differences in Non-Work at Work,” in January 2017.\\n\\nThe economists delayed publishing their findings until after the 2016 presidential election because they didn’t want to give ammunition to what Hamermesh calls “Trump and his minions” to use “as a propaganda piece.”\\n\\nAs reported by The Economist on Feb. 4, 2017, this was the study’s methodology:\\n\\nThe economists collected data from nearly 36,000 “daily diaries” — American workers’ self-reporting on how they spent their working hours, from 2003 to 2012.\\n\\nAssuming that the self-reports were honest, the economists calculated the amount of time spent not working while on the job, e.g., eating, chatting, relaxing, surfing the net, etc.\\n\\nThe study found a small but statistically significant racial and gender differences in the amount of time spent not working while on the job — even after controlling for geography, type of work, union status, and other variables. “Statistically significant” means the racial differences did not occur by chance alone. Here are the findings:\\n\\nRacial “minorities,” especially male minorities, spent larger portions of their workdays not actually working, i.e., are lazier: Hispanics are the laziest, followed by blacks, then Asians. White workers are the least lazy.\\n\\nGender differences; Hispanic and black men are lazier than Hispanic and black women. Asian women are lazier than Asian men. White men and women are about the same, with the females slightly lazier than the men.\\n\\n\\n\\nTrying to explain the racial gap, the study first considered racial discrimination as the cause — that minority workers slack off work because of discriminatory treatment by managers. But that explanation was rejected because the study found that self-employed minority workers also spent more time not working.\\n\\nSo the three economists finally resorted to the same “cultural differences” explanation that is used to account for persistent racial differences in IQ and SAT scores.\\n\\nDenunciations of the study were swift, as well as retributions against its politically incorrect findings.\\n\\nWithin hours of publication, Daniel Hamermesh — an avowed “progressive” who refers to President Trump only by derogatory amusing nicknames and who had resigned from a post at the University of Texas over a state law permitting the open carrying of firearms — received vitriolic messages and was labeled a racist in an online forum popular among economists.\\n\\nEver the liberal, Hamermesh’s proposed solution to the racial work gap is not that minorities should work more, but rather that whites should work less because “Americans work too much”.\\n\\n~Eowyn\\n\\nAdvertisements',\n",

Unified parent panel: Acrimony with racial overtones has plagued the advisory council. The key issue: whether meetings in Spanish should be allowed.\\n\\nBy Howard Blume, Los Angeles Times Staff Writer\\n\\nNovember 10, 2007 For months, parents on a Los Angeles Unified School District advisory council have disagreed over whether their meetings should be conducted in Spanish or English. Such arguments became so abusive that district officials canceled meetings for two months and brought in dispute-resolution specialists and mental-health counselors.\\n\\nBut Friday morning’s gathering of the District Advisory Council proved dysfunctional in any language.\\n\\nBy one vote, parents censured their own chairman for alleged bad behavior, leading to a walkout of most Spanish-speakers. The rebuked chairman, Roberto Fonseca, followed them out of the room. Most voting for the censure were African American, adding racial overtones to the back-and-forth hectoring.\\n\\nFriday’s dispute, at the district’s downtown Parent Community Services Branch, was the latest in a year of acrimony at the council, which was elected by parents at schools throughout the district. They offer advice on — and oversight of — the expenditure of $385 million on federally funded programs for students from poor families.\\n\\nThe goings-on raise another round of questions about parent participation in the nation’s second-largest school system, which has been repeatedly criticized by auditors for inconsistent and ineffective parent involvement and outreach. Critics say the district rarely seeks true parental input and instead uses parents to rubber-stamp budgets and programs. District officials insist they are determined to change this perception and are making progress.\\n\\nFriday’s chaos had been building since February, when Fonseca, who is bilingual, started to give his chairman’s report in Spanish. Some in the audience objected; arguments and recriminations ensued, and school police rushed over amid concerns that a fistfight would break out, witnesses said.\\n\\nPolice have been present ever since, and on Friday, they escorted several parents outside for what one administrator termed a “timeout.”\\n\\nAfter the February dispute over language, the district canceled March and April meetings, using the time to develop a Code of Civility, which reads almost like the rules in some classrooms: “Treat one another with respect, without ridicule or criticism. . . . Listen attentively while others are speaking. . . . Under no circumstances, threaten or engage in any verbal or physical attack on another individual.”\\n\\nThere was some resistance to this code, because parents had not approved it themselves, district staff said.\\n\\nWhen meetings resumed, parents set up a bylaws subcommittee to take on language and other matters. The current bylaws stipulate that parent meetings across the district must be held in English. A school-district lawyer, however, concluded that this rule is illegal and impractical. Many parents serving on local school councils don’t speak English. Some meetings consist entirely of Spanish-speakers in a district where more than 266,000 students (and probably many more parents) are English-learners out of a student population of about 694,000.\\n\\nThe bylaws committee never completed its full review but had tentatively decided to leave the English rule in place. District staff, in turn, notified schools and offices that the English rule would not be enforced.\\n\\nWhen participants on the advisory council aren’t at odds, meetings can be a model of bilingualism. When someone speaks in Spanish, English speakers put translation headsets to their ears and vice versa. And many Latino participants do speak English. The council united to oppose a recent cut in district translation services, a position that Fonseca politely announced to the Board of Education.\\n\\nLatinos appear to hold the majority of council seats, although African Americans are well represented. A handful of seats are occupied by people of other ethnicities. The council has 63 members, but it will have more than 100 after local elections are complete.\\n\\nSome observers have described the battle over language as a stand-in for a larger dispute. Federal Title 1 funding started during the civil rights era largely as a mechanism to help impoverished blacks who occupied vast swaths of South Los Angeles. The federal money has yet to eliminate low-academic achievement among African Americans.\\n\\nBut Latinos now have larger numbers in many formerly black-majority schools. And Latino parents are not content to oversee only those funds set aside for English-learners — these are generally much smaller pots of money than the federal poverty-relief dollars.\\n\\nStill, the mini-wars at the advisory committee may have more to do with difficult personalities and in-room ethnic tensions than citywide racial politics or competition over resources, others said.\\n\\nFonseca, in particular, has been a polarizing figure, although on Friday he kept his cool initially, when a black woman walked up to the podium and shouted in his face: “You are totally out of order!”\\n\\nLater, though, on one motion, an impatient Fonseca tried to shut down public comment. “I will not allow members of the public to speak,” he said.\\n\\nChris Downing, an administrator with the parent branch, intervened, as he frequently has: “The chairperson does not have the right to violate the law.” Downing then turned to the unruly audience: “Raise your hand if you want to have a nice calm meeting. . . . Take a deep breath.”\\n\\nLater, Fonseca ruled that a two-thirds vote would be needed to censure him. The district’s lawyer, John Walsh, disagreed, but Fonseca spoke out again and again: “Two-thirds! Two-thirds! Two-thirds!”\\n\\nThe resolution stated in part that Fonseca “recognized only those who upheld his views and denied the opposition the right to speak.”\\n\\nThose who walked out included Guadalupe Aguiar, one of the parents who felt that Fonseca was treated unfairly, especially because Friday was the last meeting before new elections. She added that she considers it racist when parents are told that, in America, they have to speak English.\\n\\nIn some respects, though, Aguiar spoke for a clear majority of parents.\\n\\n“I am here to bring information to my school,” she said in Spanish. “So far, I have not brought anything. It was the same thing last year and the year before. . . . Your children are failing just as mine are.”',\n",

Dru Kristenev, grew up in the publishing industry working every angle of a paper, from ad composition and sales, to personnel management, copy writing, and overseeing all editorial content.

Dru Kristenev\\n\\n\\n\\nAs globalist billionaires and politicians gather for the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland, they are encouraged to take forty-five minutes out of their busy schedule to “walk in the shoes” of a refugee. As much as benevolent organizations tout this as an opportunity to share the heartache of a refugee’s experience, it is more an exercise in hubris than compassion.\\n\\nConsider that it is the unchecked avarice of most of the participants that has created the circumstances upending lives and displacing populations. These economic movers and shakers’ vision of a global community is one that allows them free access to sack nations for their own profit. The global regime that WEF participants peddle and carry out is the very avenue by which average citizens are placed at risk of losing their homes, their livelihoods and their countries to strife and civil war.\\n\\nJan 15, 2018 — A. Dru Kristenev\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst of all, what is NAACP doing sponsoring a division to address the non-existent concept of environmental and climate justice? Before I go any deeper, it’s important to point out that the environment (earth, its elements and inhabitants) and climate (the atmosphere) are not sentient beings that crave justice from one another, the universe or man. They are components of Creation of which each of the aforementioned are interconnected not adversarial.\\n\\nFor reasoning that counters logic, the civil rights movement that Dr. Martin Luther King, jr. led has been turned on its ear by lumping inanimate objects like stone, as in geologic formations, vegetation, animate creatures and weather together with man as being mistreated by man. Never did Dr. King interchange the natural world and man, made in God’s image, as equivalents. Nor did he equate justice for man among men with the elements of the world.\\n\\nDec 25, 2017 — A. Dru Kristenev\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen we think of faith, how many of us believe that it must rise from our own being? That in order for us to be successful in achieving our dreams, we must have faith in ourselves?\\n\\nThe truth is, faith is a gift and not by the measure of the world that touts the mantra that thinking good thoughts by force of will, good things are then manifested.\\n\\nFaith is a gift of the Holy Spirit.\\n\\n1 Corinthians 12\\n\\n8 For to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit,\\n\\n9 to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit,\\n\\n10 to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. (ESV)\\n\\nDec 6, 2017 — A. Dru Kristenev\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument was designated under President Clinton’s purview in 1996, it created real hardship for regional ranchers. New management rules locked up more than one and a half million acres, discontinuing grazing leases that were imperative to sustain cattle growers who’d been using the land responsibly for more than a century.\\n\\nPart of the impetus for closing off natural resource development at the time was to halt access to one of the best sources of low sulfur coal, including from tribal populations, putting a stranglehold on arid land limited economies. Instituting the monument spelled financial disaster to Four Corners ranch industry as well as the Navajo that has tried to expand their coal industry. One of the reasons Clinton closed off the coal was a backroom deal made to bump up the price of the commodity being mined in Indonesia. It removed U.S. competition at the expense of Native America that, on the other hand, has been tagged to protest pro-growth projects like Dakota Access Pipeline and, now, truncating Bears Ears National Monument.\\n\\nNov 17, 2017 — A. Dru Kristenev\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is a problem here. Republican office holders and so-called conservative pundits are all jumping on the bandwagon to convict Judge Roy Moore based on their northeastern customs. Yes, this includes all the Fox personalities televising their holier-than-thou judgments out of New York Central along with the D.C. swamp.\\n\\nIt’s fascinating to see how these same conservatives stood by Donald Trump when women came out of the woodwork at the last minute accusing him of misconduct. In fact, even Sean Hannity had his own problem last year fighting back when women appeared in an attempt to smear him with sleazy accusations. Both these men, and others under attack by the Left, solidly denied the allegations. And guess what? We had their backs because we knew that accusations without proper evidence had no credence.\\n\\nNov 6, 2017 — A. Dru Kristenev\\n\\n\\n\\nMotive behind the devastating massacre of the faithful at a small Southern Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas is immaterial. The assumption that Christians are easy targets is not.\\n\\nThere is a perception that Christians are unarmed and unwilling to protect and preserve the lives of the ones they love. It is a misconception. Christians base their faith in love, the all-encompassing love of God that is God, 1John 4:8.\\n\\nOct 25, 2017 — A. Dru Kristenev\\n\\n\\n\\nPressure from the base is finally breaking loose the staid RINO watch. Moments before writing this, Senator Jeff Flake announced that he will not seek re-election for his Arizona seat. Following in the footsteps of Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, establishment republicans are vacating the Capitol before they’re tossed out by a Steve Bannon inspired challenge.\\n\\nThere is, however, one problem. These two, and others, still have months in office to continue Trump-trashing to promote the establishment (otherwise known as the Swamp) agenda. Even as Flake stands on the Senate floor declaring that he is standing down from office at the end of his term, he is doubling-down on his ill advised, liberal-based attacks on the president. Be assured that his quoting Madison’s Federalist 51, et al, wishing to lay the problems within Congress at the feet of President Trump, it is a projection of his own actions, his divisive rhetoric that is foundering implementation of the president’s campaign promises.\\n\\nOct 12, 2017 — A. Dru Kristenev\\n\\nMarginalizing Christianity is reaching epic proportions as LGBT, in particular, threatens believers in business and in church. Taking the discrimination to new levels beyond targeting businesses to provide service that force owners to defy the tenets of their faith, when the shoe is on the other foot LGBT business owners flatly refuse all service. For clarification – these two responses to providing service are not equal.\\n\\nAnti-discrimination laws, such as the one to be argued before the Supreme Court of the United States, have supposedly been enacted to protect individuals from being refused service based on their sexual preferences, ethnic or racial make-up. Evidently, the laws seem to be exclusionary of protecting persons with religious convictions. Hence the Masterpiece Bakery, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission case.\\n\\nOct 8, 2017 — A. Dru Kristenev\\n\\nOne after another, the left continues to stand firm encouraging bad behavior by making excuses for it. Problem? Not only is it coming from the Hollywood elite as in Harvey Weinstein’s inconsistent attorney backpedaling for his abhorrent sexual harassment but even the FBI is lending cover to violence.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nSep 24, 2017 — A. Dru Kristenev\\n\\nRemoving a child’s chance to enjoy childhood, the one time in life where there’s no responsibility to be shouldered for the woes of the world, is ever the agenda of the left. Children are targets of indoctrination from the time they enter preschool.\\n\\nImmediately they are bombarded by climate change theory, making them believe they are accountable for the earth’s mean temperature, and, among other programming, imposed confusion about what was once the simple difference between boys’ and girls’ plumbing.\\n\\nSep 14, 2017 — A. Dru Kristenev\\n\\nEvery day the left comes up with another mind-bending theory to throw against the wall and there’s always someone who buys into it without checking manufacturer instructions. For 72 hours it’d been that President Trump is the cause of the horrific hurricanes Harvey and Irma, plus José that still pummeled the Caribbean. Not that this is a new concept. President George W. Bush was blamed for Katrina and the fact that it was a racist hurricane.\\n\\nOkay, so we’ve heard it all. But have we?\\n\\nSep 10, 2017 — A. Dru Kristenev\\n\\nToday is the seventh anniversary of surrendering to an unanticipated call on my life – that of selling off most everything, packing what was left into the back of the truck and leaving what had become my home… for?\\n\\nThat was the question. I really didn’t know to what or where I was beckoned but I was certain that it was necessary to be obedient to God’s prompting. For anyone who thinks it’s a relatively simple operation to pull up roots and drop your life in the Lord’s hands, turning you at will, His will, to travel where you’ve been invited to minister, the short answer is: it isn’t.\\n\\nAug 31, 2017 — A. Dru Kristenev\\n\\nAs much as these issues may appear to be unrelated, it’s time the parallel was examined.\\n\\nWhen we look at the devastation of Harvey, blowing in and out, up and down the Gulf Coast, water is not just overwhelming neighborhoods, it is an abundant commodity (that’s how government views this essential of life). The storm, in all its configurations, has pounded the Texas shore with over a trillion gallons of water (3.06 million acre feet) according to some sources. Mind numbing as that appears, the amount is hard to comprehend for those of us not in the throes of dealing with the water and the loss it has caused.\\n\\nAug 20, 2017 — A. Dru Kristenev\\n\\nThe following may be a shock to urban centrists who think everything revolves around large population centers.\\n\\nFor some reason beyond my ken, I seem to end up in the epicenter of cultural change and, in some instances, chaos.\\n\\nThis is my third cycle in Northeast Oregon where landowners fight a pitched battle with environmentalists and their allies, state and federal government entities hiding behind protected wildlife to steal property rights and real estate.\\n\\nAug 14, 2017 — A. Dru Kristenev\\n\\nAs much as the usual suspects—left-leaning press, politicians and professors—are quick to blame every ill in society on all people with light-toned skin, the irrational head-bashing that occurred in the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia Saturday will continue.\\n\\nThis nation was established on free speech, the concept of which has been twisted by progressive ideologues to mean “approved speech,” destroying the purpose of this most important aspect of the First Amendment. And on this day, someone died amid the havoc wrought by the arrival of counter protesters who believe that free speech means closing it down, and in attempting to do just that, they created an environment where the only thing heard were hurled epithets and thuds of delivered blows.\\n\\nAug 4, 2017 — A. Dru Kristenev\\n\\nAs soon as President Trump and Senators Cotton and Perdue finished their brief introduction of the RAISE Act, the blowback from liberals reached gale force. Immediately, the cry became how the proposed bill discriminates against non-English speaking and low skilled workers who might seek to come to the United States. As to the preference for admitting English-speakers, White House aide, Stephen Miller, handled the issue with aplomb, setting aside any need to revisit it here.\\n\\nJul 13, 2017 — A. Dru Kristenev\\n\\nIn light of President Trump’s advocacy of Western values at the G-20, hard questions must be asked of our current would-be parents, those of childbearing age.\\n\\nMore and more young people in Western cultures are opting to avoid procreation and sidestep the responsibility of raising a family. The justifications for choosing to remain single or create a relationship consisting of a married (or ‘committed’) couple and pets is burgeoning among the millennial and following generation—for the life of me, I can’t keep straight the ‘X’, ‘Y’, ‘Z’ nomenclature.\\n\\nThus the query stands—who will raise the next generation of teachers and preachers, let alone skilled labor, professionals and elected officials? Looks like it’s not going to be American, Canadian, European or other ‘first world’ citizens adhering to their native culture. They’re too busy with other endeavors, of which grooming youngsters to continue the West’s legacy is not among their priorities.\\n\\nJul 7, 2017 — A. Dru Kristenev\\n\\nDisavowing God’s handiwork in order to remake Mankind (irony intended), United Kingdom’s National Health Service is well on its way to transplanting wombs into men so they may have the blessed experience of giving birth.\\n\\nThe obvious question is ‘why?’ Especially when the NHS does everything in its power to curtail the life of an infant whose natural parents are scouring every avenue to find medical answers to his maladies. The European Court of Human Rights refused to challenge the decision to shut down the baby’s life support. Is Charlie Gard not human that he has rights? Misnomers abound in our upside-down world with the NHS calling for “equality enshrined in law” to supply transgender females with wombs but staunchly deny breath to defenseless infants. With more than a million dollars raised to bring the child to the United States to undergo experimental treatment that even President Trump has encouraged, still the UK courts side with the hospital to pull the plug.\\n\\nJul 6, 2017 — A. Dru Kristenev\\n\\nWe have a real problem when a virtual social order imagines itself to be able to take the place of human contact. The embodiment of living in a fantasy world, social media promotes existence on a level of reality that is fanciful.\\n\\nModern culture has come to a crisis stage where individuals are taught that it is enough to reach out via the internet or text to establish personal contact with another person. It isn’t. And Mark Zuckerberg’s assertion that social media is the “new church” brings home just how dysfunctional is the concept: “If we can do this, it will not only turn around the whole decline in community membership we’ve seen for decades, it will start to strengthen our social fabric and bring the world closer together…”\\n\\nJun 21, 2017 — A. Dru Kristenev\\n\\nDepending on who happens to wield the weapon of choice (be it gun, knife, bomb or motor vehicle) there seems to be a real dispute regarding the label’s application. Officials sit on their hands before calling it terrorism when it comes to dozens and hundreds (Paris 11/13/15) of Christians, conservatives, concert-goers or baseball fans losing life and limb.\\n\\nMonday morning’s incident of a van driver mowing down individuals outside of a Finsbury Park mosque in North London was a different story. Politically correct officials had no compunction applying the term terrorist to the vehicle’s operator that was described as “white” which, by the way, also applies to the majority of the world’s muslims, whether they are of Arab, Persian, Pakistani or European descent—all are white or Caucasian. Whereas any of the previous terror attacks in Britain (London Bridge, Westminster and Manchester) were tardily tagged as such, including the Lord Mayor Sadiq Khan’s telling Londoners that terror is now an accepted risk of living in a big city, it demonstrates an obvious prejudice in favor of the muslim community at the expense of other Britons.',\n",

       " ('AEI’s Stan Veuger:\\n\\nThe economic impact of the president’s executive actions, while probably positive overall, is unlikely to change these attitudes. It will be small and unevenly distributed, but the administration is portraying it differently, running the risk of creating expectations that will not be met. Its projections may not be as disingenuous as the president’s “[i]f you like your plan, you can keep your plan” lies, but they are skewed in a way that reminds one of the administration’s claims that raising the federal minimum wage will destroy not a single job and lead to a massive consumer spending boom. The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that the president’s executive order will increase gross domestic product by 0.4 percent after 10 years, will not affect the likelihood of employment for native workers while raising their wages and will cut deficits by $25 billion in 2024. Much like the council’s minimum wage increase forecasts, these numbers appear to be based on fairly extreme assumptions, even though it refers to them as “lower-bound” estimates.\\n\\nFor example, about three quarters of the Council of Economic Advisers’ estimate of increased GDP is driven by administrative actions that encourage high-skilled immigration. These actions have not received nearly as much attention as the administrative actions helping undocumented, generally low-skilled immigrants, probably because they affect fewer people and the people affected never broke immigration law. To gauge the impact of this increase in high-skilled immigration, the council relies on parameters from a paper by two economists from the University of California, Davis and one from Colgate University who believe that foreign science, technology, engineering and mathematics workers are responsible for as much as half of the productivity growth in the U.S. over the past couple of decades. That is certainly not an uncontroversial view: For example, in an arguably better identified study, economists at the University of Notre Dame, the Treasury Department and the University of California at Berkeley have found that many of these workers merely replace native workers, and produce no patents that would not have otherwise been produced. Note that this is not a partisan issue: The Berkeley economist who co-authored the second paper, for example, served as a political appointee in the Obama administration.',\n",

       " ('ALBERT WOHLSTETTER, better than almost any other American strategic thinker, understood Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian dictator who died at The Hague where he was on trial for genocide. Writing in the Wall Street Journal in 1995, Wohlstetter drew a direct line between Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and the Balkan butcher: \"The successful coalition in the Gulf War . . . left in place a Ba\\'ath dictatorship . . . .That told Slobodan Milosevic, who is not a slow learner, that the West would be even less likely . . . to stop his own overt use of the Yugoslav Federal Army to create a Greater Serbia purged of non-Serbs.\"\\n\\nWohlstetter was not the only person to recognize the evil of Milosevic. Margaret Thatcher was a prominent advocate of direct and firm action against Serbian aggression. She recalled indignantly in 1999, \"The West could have stopped Milosevic in Slovenia or Croatia in 1991, or in Bosnia in 1992.\" In 1995, Milosevic was slowed, at least, by the Dayton Accord, which, however, left Bosnian Serbs with most of the country and treated Milosevic, who had incited them to mass murder, rape, and wholesale vandalism, as a more or less respectable figure. In 1999, four years after Dayton, 33 prominent foreign policy experts, including John Bolton and Paul Wolfowitz, signed a statement calling on President Clinton to end the \"pact with the devil\" signed at Dayton and to intervene immediately in Kosovo, the last setting for Milosevic\\'s theater of the macabre. So we did, and Milosevic was stopped.\\n\\nHe was deposed by his countrymen in 2000, deported to The Hague by the Yugoslav government, and put on trial before a special tribunal. At the trial he attempted to present himself as a prescient and courageous defender of the West against al Qaeda. According to him, the murder of elderly Muslim peasants in remote districts of Bosnia or Kosovo was a blow against Islamist terrorism. In 2002, he even tried to claim American government support for the allegation that \"mujahedeen\" had fought in Kosovo. In reality, while some 2,000-4,000 Saudi-backed \"Arab Afghans\" intruded into the Bosnian conflict, they failed to influence the course of the fighting, and their form of Islam repelled the European Bosnians.\\n\\nAnd now the brute will be buried, leaving a legacy of some 250,000 dead (mostly Bosnian Muslims), thousands of victims of rape (also mostly Bosnian Muslims), and the economic and cultural wreckage of the former Yugoslavia. His vision of a Greater Serbia resulted in the reality of a Lesser Serbia, reduced to the country as it existed in 1911, plus war booty taken from the Hungarians after World War I (Vojvodina in the north) and two unhappily acquired possessions that may soon be gone, Montenegro and Kosovo. Montenegro, annexed in 1918, is preparing a referendum on secession from its current \"federation\" with Serbia for May of this year, and the \"final status\" of Kosovo, conquered by Serbia in 1912, is being negotiated by the international community.\\n\\nMilosevic will be remembered as the man who, at the end of the 20th century, reintroduced mass atrocities into a Europe that had ostensibly banished them forever. Milosevic\\'s retro political style included \"ethnic cleansing\" or mass expulsion; internment in concentration camps; grotesque torture and sexual terrorism; gratuitous slaughter of whole families, villages, and even the equivalent of a significant town--8,000 Muslim males at Srebrenica, and the systematic destruction of holy places and cultural landmarks. All was carried out by lawless gangs and \"militias,\" in addition to the Yugoslav army.\\n\\nSome Western \"realists,\" looking for excuses not to act, could not help asserting the moral equivalence of Milosevic and his victims. But neither the Croats, nor the Bosnian Muslims, nor the Kosovar Albanians ever attacked Serbia or Montenegro. In an attempt at psychological distancing from the crimes of the Belgrade regime, some Westerners harped endlessly on Croatian and Bosnian Muslim collaboration with the Nazis in the Second World War, even though as many or more Croats were anti-fascist Partisans as helped the Nazis, and Bosnian Muslim clerics interceded on behalf of Jewish and Serb victims of the Germans.\\n\\nMilosevic, the man pushed to the foreground by the crisis, was a mediocrity, like Saddam Hussein or, for that matter, his hero Stalin. Milosevic was a product of Communist rule in a remote provincial town, Pozarevac, in Serbia, and of a narrow, bureaucratic culture. There is no evidence that he cared about the Serb people or Serbian traditions; but he certainly loved authority over others. When he gained power, after working his way through the Tito party system, he used it to posture as a world-historical figure. But he was similar to Vladimir Putin in Russia: an empty vessel waiting to be filled by new ideologies or mafia business opportunities once communism ended.\\n\\nIt is appropriate that Milosevic was an ally of Saddam, who also killed quite a few Muslims--and an ally of other anti-Americans. Evil finds its compatriots. So Iraq supplied energy-poor Serbia with oil. Iraq contracted with Serbia for sophisticated weapons and their maintenance. Serbia had a WMD program, including a nuclear bomb effort dating from the Tito years, finally shut down only in 2002, when enough highly enriched uranium for at least two nuclear weapons was removed from an institute near Belgrade in a joint U.S.-Russian effort supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency.\\n\\nMilosevic was also, in his time, supported by the late, unlamented Yasser Arafat, who even invited him to Bethlehem, in the territory of the Palestinian Authority. (Israel blocked the trip by making it clear that, as a good member of the United Nations, it would arrest Milosevic and hand him over to The Hague.) What counted to people like Saddam and Arafat was, of course, Serbia\\'s confrontation with America, not its attempted genocide of Bosnian Muslims. And when the U.S.-led coalition went into Iraq in 2003 to remove Saddam (who incidentally was a more direct threat to American interests in 2003 than Milosevic was in 1999), many of the same people opposed that intervention as well. Some acted out of decent motives and made respectable arguments--and some simply liked dictators and hated America. So Slobodan and Saddam ended up sharing the legal help of the disgraceful Ramsey Clark.\\n\\nYet the suffering of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the Balkan war of 1992-95 produced important effects. The nightmare of Bosnia--all those people killed only for their names, the rapes, the mosques destroyed down to their foundations--affected Muslims throughout the world, as did the apparent indifference of much of \"Christian Europe\" to the horror. After all, British policy was shaped not by Lady Thatcher, but by the cruelly shortsighted team of Lord Carrington, Lord Douglas Hurd, and Lord David Owen. U.S. policy did not follow the path recommended by Ronald Reagan or John McCain. It was based first on the pseudo-\"realism\" of James Baker, then left at the mercy of the fecklessness of Warren Christopher.\\n\\nSo Muslims around the world have not forgotten Bosnia. While Westerners tend to dismiss the Balkans as a fringe area of the Islamic world, many Muslims view Bosnian Islam with respect. Precisely because it suffered, and defended itself, and survived as a community of Islamic believers in the heart of Europe, Bosnia has credibility and prestige among Muslims, from Saudi dissidents to Malayan Sufis.\\n\\nBosnian Islam, which showed its moderation during the recent war, therefore represents a real asset for a Europe coming to grips with the Islamic challenge. In the middle of the uproar and shouts--and some brutal slayings--accompanying the recent controversy over the Danish cartoons, the chief Muslim cleric of Bosnia, Mustafa Ceric, issued a Declaration to European Muslims. In an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty accompanying the declaration, Ceric described the text as \"a personal act . . . sending a message to the Western audience that we, Bosnian Muslims, did not agree with the terrorist attacks in New York on September 11, 2001, on March 11, 2004, in Madrid, on July 7, 2005, in London.\"\\n\\nIn the declaration itself, Ceric writes sharply, \"Muslims should not be afraid to think about their future in the same way as they should not be possessed by their past. . . . Not only have Muslims failed to produce a genuine idea of globalization, but they are, generally speaking, failing now at living in a global world.\" In an introduction to the declaration, Ceric argues, \"Muslims must realize that the general feeling about their faith in Europe today is unfavorable. European Muslims must take the issue of violence in the name of Islam very seriously, not because some people hate Islam and Muslims, but because the act of violence, the act of terror, the act of hatred in the name of Islam is wrong. . . .European Muslims must develop a program for anti-violence.\" Ceric reproaches the ruling caste in Muslim countries that \"claims to defend Islam, but, in fact . . . uses (or misuses) Islam to cover up its own shortcomings.\"\\n\\nBosnians like Ceric survived the time of Milosevic without sharing in the evil he represented. Such Bosnians can serve as intellectual and moral examples for moderate Muslims around the world. And Europeans can benefit from treating them as trustworthy partners. The death of Milosevic does not close the book on the disaster of the Yugoslav wars; major criminals remain at large. But the fact that Balkan Muslims remained stubbornly commited to civilized values is notable. It deserves to be remembered as people of good will contemplate the future of Islam in Europe and beyond.\\n\\n--Stephen Schwartz and William Kristol',\n",

It is a Washington tradition to overthrow elected Latin American governments that try to represent the interest of the people, and not the interest of US corporations and banks.\\n\\nI wrote about Washington’s attack on Latin American reformers on April 11 (http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2016/04/11/washington-continues-to-destroy-latin-american-reformers-paul-craig-roberts/) and on April 22\\n\\n(http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2016/04/22/washington-launches-its-attack-against-brics-paul-craig-roberts/).\\n\\nDecades ago US Marine General Smedley Butler confessed that he was “a gangster for capitalism,” imposing the will of New York Banks and the United Fruit Company on Latin American countries by force of arms.\\n\\nIn his book, Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, John Perkins reports the 1981 assassinations of Panama President Omar Torrijos and Ecuador President Jaime Roldos, both of whom got in the way of US corporate interests.\\n\\nAfter being duly demonized by the US media, in 2009 Honduras President Manuel Zelaya, who thought that Honduras should be for Hondurans and not for the United Fruit Company, was overthrown in a military coup greenlighted by President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The president chosen by the people was replaced with Roberto Micheletti, a tool of US corporations, chosen by Washington.\\n\\nWashington has been conducting economic warfare against Venezuela in order to undermine\\n\\nPresident Maduro’s public support. The media is controlled by the elite and blames Maduro for the economic problems caused by Washington.\\n\\nWashington has succeeded in having its agents among the elite regain control of Venezuela’s National Assembly.

       " (\"According to a poll by the Bertelsmann Foundation in 2010, which was repeated in 2012, 80 to 90% of Germans and Austrians want a “new economic order”. Obviously, the time is ripe for a new “great transformation” (Karl Polanyi), in the direction of embedding the economy into the social context, into constitutional values and into the ecological foundations of life.\\n\\nThe majority of the people are already there. According to another representative poll, 67% the Germans wish a Gross National Happiness to replace the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a tool to measure a nation's success. This would serve put the economy in coherence with democratic constitutions. According to the constitution of the German state of Bavaria, “the entire economic activity serves the common good”. The German Basic Law, which serves as the country’s constitution, says, “The ownership of property carries certain responsibilites. It's use shall always serve the welfare of all.”\\n\\nThe Economy for the Common Good (ECG) is a 5 years young alternative economic model where economic actors – businesses, investors, consumers, public institutions – strive for the common good and not for financial gain or GDP growth.\\n\\nThe core of the idea is that financial gain and growth are merely the means to the overall goal of improving the common good. Presently they are seen as a goal in and of themselves. Economic success is currently measured using monetary indicators like GDP, financial profit or the return on investment. Success is not measured in terms of human needs, quality of life the and realization of fundamental values.\\n\\nA “Common Good Product” for countries, a “Common Good Balance Sheet” for businesses and an “Ethical Creditworthiness Assessment” (CGCA) for banks will fundamentally rectify this distorted practice. For instance, good balance sheet results of companies shall be rewarded with lower taxes and tariffs, better loan conditions and priority in public procurement. Banks will only grant loans if the ethical assessment is positive. Thanks to these legal incentives, ethical products and services would become cheaper for consumers than less ethical ones. And only responsible businesses can survive whereas non-ethical business would perform worse in the marketplace.\\n\\nThe strongest advantage of the ECG is that is not merely a theoretical model. The Economy for the Common Good (ECG) is an international movement which started in October 2010 on the initiative of a dozen companies in Austria. Since then, more than 2000 businesses from almost 50 nations have joined the movement, 350 of them have already implemented the common good balance sheet including an external audit. On the political level the movement seeks to bring about changes to current legislation via democratic bottom-up processes. In order to achieve this, the movement proposes decentralized, democratic conventions in which all core entities of a new economic order - market, money, property, competition/cooperation, success indicators, external costs, financial systems, trade regime etc. – will be discussed by the sovereign citizens with the goal of drafting a new „economic constitution“.\\n\\nThe Economy for the Common Good, a model based on humane values\\n\\nLimitation of inequality\\n\\nOne example of such a sovereign decision could be the limitation of inequality. According to a survey publishes by the Financial Times, between 78 and 87% of respondents in the USA, China and Germany felt that inequity has increased too much. The ECG movement has asked audiences in 25 countries if and where they would cap top incomes according to minimum wages. Participants usually say that the maximum income of top managers should be somewhere between 3 and 100 times higher than minimum wage. In these “rehearsals” of the democratic conventions, all suggestions are voted on, measuring the opposition of each person against each proposal. Participants (voters in the audience) can either raise no hands, one hand or two hands expressing their opposition to each proposal. Holding up no hands shows no opposition, one hand shows some and two hands show a lot of opposition. The winner is the proposal that provokes the least opposition. In more than 90% of all of these real-life simulations, 10 is usually the winner, meaning a top manager should not earn more that 10 times as much as minimum wage.\\n\\nIn the real world the situation is very different. In Austria top earners earn 1150 times as much as minimum wage, in Germany it’s 6000 times as much and in the U.S. up to 350,000 times as much. This is a clear example that the sovereign citizens would take a drastically different decision on such a key issue than their representatives do today.\\n\\nTrade as a means, not an end\\n\\nA second example is trade. Trade is not considered an end in itself, as it is the perspective of WTO, BIT and TTIP rules. Nor it is regarded a bad thing as strict protectionists would deem it. ECG considers trade as a means to achieve a democratic society's goals. If trade proves to protect human and labor rights and enhance sustainable development then it is welcomed. If it contributes to a more just distribution and stronger social cohesion then it should be supported. If it closes the gender gap and includes disadvantaged people in the creation of welfare, then again more trade is welcomed. If, on the other hand, trade endangers these values and the common goods, then less trade is better. Accordingly, all companies that want access to the world market should be required to present a common good balance sheet. Depending on the result, they get free access to the market or they pay certain tariffs or they do not receive access at all. Trade would turn into an instrument of sustainable development, human rights and the common good.\\n\\nThe ECG Movement\\n\\nAlthough it is so young, the movement is made up of hundreds of companies, municipalities and universities. A major success was recently celebrated at the European Union. The European Economic and Social Committee, a 350 members advisory body to the European Commission and Parliament, approved an “opinion” on the Economy for the Common Good. It was voted in its plenary session in September 2015. The result: 86% of its members support the statement “that the Economy for the Common Good (ECG) model is conceived to be included both in the European and the domestic legal framework”.\\n\\nIn September 2016, a first tour through the USA will take place from the 13th till the 22nd of September to plant the first seeds of the ECG in the US, all information here: www.changeeverything.info/tour/\\n\\nHere you can find a short explanatory video on the ECG\\n\\nChristian Felber, born in 1972, studied Spanish Language, Psychology, Sociology and Political Sciences in Madrid and Wien. He wrote and coauthored 15 books and teaches at Vienna University of Economics and Business. He is an international speaker, contemporary dancer and founder of the Economy for the Common Good movement.

       " ('According to new reporting this month, Donald Trump allegedly had a consensual affair with a paid pornographic actress who went by the stage name Stormy Daniels in 2006, one year after marrying his third wife and just months after his son Barron Trump was born. Daniels consented to the release of an extensive 2011 interview in which she described the affair in explicit detail. The Wall Street Journal revealed that Michael Cohen, an attorney working for Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet about the affair. What’s more, he did so through a Delaware LLC to which Cohen was attached as the “authorized person” rather than a third party with some distance from the future president. This thing is pretty airtight.\\n\\nWhat’s interesting is that, so far, Trump’s defenders are not following the president’s lead and denying that this affair occurred. As an entertainer and publicity seeker, Donald Trump made a virtue of his penchant for adultery. Jaws around the nation did not drop over the allegation that the president might not have been faithful to his third wife. These revelations do serve as another opportunity to check in with the religious right just to make sure they remain comfortable with the double standard they have reserved for Trump. And, yes, they’re still good with it.\\n\\nIn an interview with Politico, Family Research Council President Tony Perkins confessed that the community of moral leaders on the right gave Trump a “mulligan” for the debauchery in which he engaged before he became a political figure. He said that the religious right is “tired of being kicked around” by the left and are “glad” there’s “somebody on the playground that is willing to punch the bully.” What about turning the other cheek, Perkins’s interlocutor asked. “You know, you only have two cheeks,” he replied.\\n\\nPerkins is getting a lot of grief for that, but his honest assessment of the transactional nature of the evangelical community’s moral compromise is illuminating. “That support is not unconditional,” he said. “If the president for some reason stopped keeping campaign promises and then engaged in that behavior now, the support’s gone.” In other words, if Trump stops delivering for them in office, this community of formerly self-righteous moral scolds reserves the right to rediscover their principles.\\n\\nMany have offered theories as to why these and many other evangelical leaders compromised themselves for Trump. Less attention has been paid to whether the moral majority’s acceptance of Trumpian turpitude represents a depressing new normal. Is this the standard of ethical degradation to which all will be held in the future? If Perkins’ admission is reflective of unspoken sentiments broadly shared on the right, the answer is no. Trump’s is a standard to which only the politically valuable are held.\\n\\nThere was some justified fear that the Trump standard was being broadly applied in November when the right’s moral gymnasts engaged in a collective defense of Alabama justice Roy Moore. They joined with the institutional GOP to ratify Donald Trump’s support for the GOP nominee for U.S. Senate despite his contempt for the law, the Constitution, and the credible allegations that he had abused underage girls. But once Moore lost, his utility was spent. As Breitbart’s Alex Marlow confessed, the accusations against Moore were credible, but the impulse to protect Trump—not Moore, per se—from his detractors was more important than moral rectitude. This, too, was transactional.\\n\\nConservatives might be tempted to retreat into a persecution complex. After all, defending Trump’s repeated indiscretions is a full-time job and one that the left seems conspicuously able to avoid. The Trump standard is the Bill Clinton standard, they might say, and it’s about time that Republicans held a mirror up to Democrats and their enablers in media. Stringent moral standards were shackles by which the right constrained itself, thus allowing the left to operate with impunity. Good riddance.\\n\\nBut the Trump standard and the Clinton standard seem reserved for presidents. Anthony Weiner, David Wu, and John Edwards did not benefit from the Clinton standard. Al Franken and John Conyers’ appeals to precedent didn’t salvage their political careers. Similarly, even in just the last 12 months, personal indiscretions were enough to cut short the political careers of Republicans like Blake Farenthold, Joe Barton, and Tim Murphy.\\n\\nSome might push back against the notion that we can draw broader conclusions from these politicians’ experiences because Rep. Patrick Meehan and Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens have managed to hold on despite the sex scandals engulfing their careers. Their careers might withstand calls for their resignations; time will tell. But their experiences reinforce the fact that there really are no universal moral standards. There are only individuals. And the actions of those individuals are condemned or condoned as a result of calculated cost/benefit analyses, not morality. It was always ever thus.\\n\\nIf this doesn’t sound like cause for optimism to you, buck up. Presidential politics is unique because the stakes at the presidential level are so high. Both parties tend to reflect their titular leaders, but presidents are transitory figures. The Republican Party’s status quo ante was Mitt Romney, John McCain, George W. Bush, Bob Dole, and so on; men of moral fortitude who had no stomach for conspiratorial thinking, nativist acrimony, or degeneracy. A reversion to the mean is perfectly imaginable.\\n\\nIf such a reversion is in the cards, no one who compromised their stated values in the Trump era should be allowed to forget the bargain they made. Yet this presidency has exposed a valuable truth: too often, ethical considerations are situational and conditional—particularly in politics. If American moral decline is going to be arrested, the country’s self-styled moral leaders must confront that fact and realize the extent to which they’ve contributed to the plunge.',\n",

I've grudgingly resigned myself to the fact that Obama won't prosecute members of the Bush administration for war crimes. But continuing, in even a minor way, Bush's policies on interrogation and detention? Unacceptable.\\n\\nA promising sign: the story is thin on sourcing and specifics, and includes this caveat:\\n\\nAdvisers caution that few decisions will be made until the team gets a better picture of how the Bush administration actually goes about gathering intelligence, including covert programs, and there could be a greater shift after a full review.\\n\\nStill, the story is alarming, Especially this:\\n\\nAs a candidate, Mr. Obama said the CIA's interrogation program should adhere to the same rules that apply to the military, which would prohibit the use of techniques such as waterboarding. He has also said the program should be investigated. Yet he more recently voted for a White House-backed law to expand eavesdropping powers for the National Security Agency. Mr. Obama said he opposed providing legal immunity to telecommunications companies that aided warrantless surveillance, but ultimately voted for the bill, which included an immunity provision. The new president could take a similar approach to revising the rules for CIA interrogations, said one current government official familiar with the transition. Upon review, Mr. Obama may decide he wants to keep the road open in certain cases for the CIA to use techniques not approved by the military, but with much greater oversight.\\n\\nOn one hand, I have trouble believing that Obama wouldn't take an unconditional stand against torture. On the other, I've seen enough to know that civil liberties, especially prisoners' rights, are often sacrificed on the altar of political expediency.\\n\\nI hope Obama denies this story, and soon.\",\n",

Something all these foaming at the mouth hawk wannabes forget is what happened to Iraq when they invaded. If you think the insurgent attacks we\\'re facing in Iraq are bad, compare that with what Iran did, Iranians were lining up to become martyrs, and they suicide bombed the Iraqi army back to the border.

Ryan stopped executions on his watch in order to dramatize the point that capital punishment requires a higher correlation between conviction and guilt than presently exists in the justice system.\\n\\nGov. Ryan’s blanket commutation is not without injustice as some of those whose lives he has spared are clearly guilty.\\n\\nOn the other hand, his stand is consistent with the highest principle of justice as exemplified by famed jurist William Blackstone’s dictum that it is better that ten guilty men go free than one innocent be imprisoned (much less executed).\\n\\nGov. Ryan is correct that the criminal justice system must be refocused on justice and turned away from the emphasis on conviction at all cost, regardless of innocence or guilt.\\n\\nFor good to come from Gov. Ryan’s controversial action, it is important that two points be kept in mind:\\n\\n(1) Wrongful conviction is not limited to capital crimes and is more prevalent in lesser crimes, and\\n\\n(2) the justice system must return to Blackstone’s concept of law as a shield of the innocent and abandon Jeremy Bentham’s concept of law as a weapon in the hands of prosecutors.\\n\\nIn other words, the problem of criminal justice goes far beyond the death penalty.\\n\\nBenthamites have marched through the justice system cutting down the principles that protected justice. The ancient principle that crime requires intent has been abolished. The prohibitions against retroactive law and bills of attainder have fallen. Torture has been reintroduced in the form of the coerced plea bargain.\\n\\nThe past week alone brought three Benthamite atrocities. In Fairfax County, Virginia, police are following Bentham’s prescription of rounding up people who might commit crimes before the fact by arresting patrons in bars for having elevated blood-alcohol.\\n\\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission proposed a regulation that abrogates the attorney-client privilege by requiring corporate lawyers to rat on their clients.\\n\\nIn another rule proposal, the SEC wants to punish the innocent for the actions of the guilty by delisting from stock exchanges companies that do not have outside directors on their audit committees. Such delisting would harm innocent shareholders who would be unable to sell their holdings.\\n\\nAll of these actions are motivated by determination to nail malefactors, real or potential, regardless of the harm inflicted on the innocent. Law is trampled in the name of preventing someone from violating it.\\n\\nGov. Ryan has opened a needed debate, which, if we can keep our eye on the important issues, could restore justice to the justice system.\\n\\nThe focus must be kept on wrongful conviction, not on the death penalty. The injustice lies in the wrongful conviction, not in the penalty, and the wrongfully convicted who are not on death row deserve our concern, too.\\n\\nORDER IT NOW\\n\\nWe must resist efforts to politicize wrongful conviction as a manifestation of racial or class bias. Black juries are actually more suspicious of prosecutorial misconduct than white suburban juries. Prosecutors have greater ease in framing white-collar defendants with arcane regulatory interpretations than they do framing the poor with well-defined common law crimes.\\n\\nPlea bargains have to go, because most are coerced by prosecutors piling on charges until the accused cops a plea.\\n\\nLaw schools must again inculcate the ethic, so well expressed by George Sutherland and Robert Jackson, that the prosecutor’s duty is to see that justice is done, not to win convictions in order to justify a budget or further a career with high-profile convictions.\\n\\nIf we fail in these tasks, Gov. Ryan’s gesture will have been in vain.\\n\\nPaul Craig Roberts is the author with Lawrence M. Stratton of The Tyranny of Good Intentions : How Prosecutors and Bureaucrats Are Trampling the Constitution in the Name of Justice.

       " ('Afghanistan\\'s Coming Humanitarian Disaster\\n\\nAs the U.S. bombing campaign of Afghanistan enters its first week, the humanitarian crisis that aid groups have been warning against seems inevitable. According to Russia\\'s Interfax News Agency, which was among the few news organizations to report actual numbers of refugees on Thursday night, 350,000 people have amassed in the northern Panjsher Gorge and over 150,000 in the provinces of Tahor and Badakhshan. There was no information available about the likely larger number of refugees on the Afghan-Pakistan border.\"People are fleeing their homes, while the humanitarian organizations have ceased activities everywhere but the northern parts of the country because of the air strikes,\" said the Northern Alliance\\'s Public Relations Minister Dr. Kanuni.Since Oct. 9, the U.N. refugee agency has been forced to halt work at six planned refugee camps on the Pakistan border because of opposition from Afghan tribal groups. U.N. officials have said that more than a million Afghans may flee their country in the coming weeks if the U.S. attacks continue and serious fighting breaks out, with 1.5 million risking death by starvation this winter. Pakistan already shelters more than 2 million Afghan refugees and Pakistani officials have stated they do not want refugees in their urban areas.On Oct. 10 members of the U.S. Senate foreign relations committee heard testimonies from representatives of humanitarian groups, who questioned the effectiveness of the daily air drops of 37,000 food packets, especially given that they will be used by tribal groups, now struggling for prominence in the political vacuum caused by the war, to manipulate civilians\\' alliances rather than to prevent hunger.The food drops \"appear to be intended more to send a political message to the Afghan people and to the Muslim world than to reach large numbers of people at risk of starvation,\" said Kenneth Bacon, a former Pentagon spokesman who now heads up Refugees International. Other aid workers have pointed out that 37,000 food packets are an incredibly small number considering the masses of people going hungry in Afghanistan.However government aid groups have stated the deliveries may grow and are aimed at saving lives. \"When you\\'re feeding people, you\\'re making a statement,\" said Andrew Natsios, an administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development. \"I don\\'t think that\\'s bad, I think that\\'s good ... We want to send a message.\"One of the questions humanitarian aid workers are asking is, should mass starvation come, and should Afghanistan be depleted of almost all resources as a result of the war, will the U.S. spend the billions of dollars necessary to prevent a long-term humanitarian crisis. Delaware Senator Joseph Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has argued the U.S. should, and has criticized the Bush administration\\'s previous pledge of $320 million in humanitarian aid as insufficient. British Prime Minister Tony Blair has been urging the Bush administration to rethink its statement that it \"will not be involved in nation building\" in Afghanistan.And indeed, in an Oct. 11 news conference President Bush retreated from his previous position, stating the U.S. would be involved in Afghanistan after the ousting of the Taliban and would work with the U.N. \"to take over the \\'nation building\\'\" for the \"stabilization of a future government.\" Bush even urged American children to send a dollar to the White House to help rebuild Afghanistan.Zieba Shorish-Shamley, director of the Women\\'s Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in Afghanistan, praised Bush\\'s promise to help rebuild Afghanistan and work with the U.N, though she said she has heard such promises before. \"No government should be imposed on the Afghan people,\" said Shorish-Shamley. \"If the nation of Afghanistan is ever to extricate itself from the current chaos, an interim government must be formed that includes representatives from all 23 tribal groups, the participation of women and bona fide oversight from the United Nations, followed by democratic elections.\"Given the U.S government\\'s policy record in Afghanistan, Shorish-Shamley is certain a democracy cannot be formed only with U.S. assistance. \"What the U.S. government created during the Cold War and afterwards in Afghanistan was the seeds for permanent violence. It spent billions of dollars on arms and training of the very soldiers who have become terrorists.\"Shorish-Shamley adds that the greatest challenge for peace and democracy in Afghanistan is to remove the influence of governments that have created warring factions in the post-civil war era. \"After 1989, the U.S. totally dropped Afghanistan, providing no help for reconstruction,\" she said. \"That\\'s when Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and practically all Afghanistan\\'s neighboring countries moved in, making it impossible for a coalition government to come about and securing the rise of the ruthless Taliban.\"Shorish-Shamley also believes that the Afghan people will not accept a puppet regime forced into power by any diplomatic initiative. \"People in Afghanistan may not be educated in the formal sense, but after over two dozen years of war and rule by fear they will not abide another foreign-imposed government.\" Shorish-Shamley argues that the participation of Afghan women in a coalition government should be primary in any U.S. or U.N. diplomacy. \"Women are the majority population in Afghanistan,\" she said. \"They have been living in terror and the protection of their rights must be part the deal.\"It is impossible to know the outcome of the current bombing campaign in Afghanistan. Taliban military targets are running out. The U.S. government, for the moment, is reluctant to put air strikes behind the Northern Alliance forces outside Kabul to allow them to overrun the city. The Taliban may never be able to deliver Osama bin Laden to the U.S. government, a stipulation of ending the war.What is clear is that millions of Afghan civilians may die over the next few months. Shorish-Shamley reports there are 300,000 pregnant women in Afghanistan with no access to medical care. One out of four children born in Afghanistan today die within the first few years of their life. \"If you could think of a worst nightmare, this is it,\" said Shorish-Shamley. \"Food drops don\\'t hurt, but they don\\'t really help.\"',\n",

       " ('After Maine Gov. Paul LePage delivered an ultimatum to state lawmakers, promising to provoke a government shutdown should the state\\'s legislature hand him a budget that includes a tax increase, it appears the governor intends to keep his word.\\n\\nLePage told reporters at the state capital that he won\\'t sign anything Friday, ensuring that a shutdown will begin at midnight, because the current budget proposalwhich was endorsed late Thursday by a special panel of lawmakers but has not yet been approved by the state legislature, includes a 1.5% lodging tax increase.\\n\\nAccording to the Bangor Daily News, the budget package currently under consideration would raise the lodging tax from 9% to 10.5%. The budget does, however, include a 3% cut to an education surtax on individuals earning more than $200,000. LePage has also taken issue with the size of the $7.1 billion budget.\\n\\nTo be sure, it’s not entirely certain that the budget will even make it to the governor’s desk before the day is over. That’s because LePage has asked the state’s House Republicans to oppose the deal, which was negotiated by Senate President Mike Thibodeau, R-Winterport, and House Speaker Sara Gideon, D-Freeport.\\n\\nLePage has embraced brash rhetoric during the budget fight, accusing lawmakers of “trying to put a gun to the governor’s head.\"\\n\\n“This budget they have has no prayer, and if they’re hell-bent on bringing this budget down, we will shut down at midnight tonight and we will talk to them in 10 days,” LePage said.\\n\\nLePage’s comments came hours before the House and Senate were due to vote on the compromise spending plan.\\n\\nGideon, the democratic opposition leader, said lawmakers should focus on ginning up the two-thirds support that a deal would need. The governor can only legally sit on the budget for ten days before either vetoing or signing it. Once it has been vetoed, the legislature could override the governor with a two-thirds majority vote.\\n\\n“If we do not do that and if the governor then does not do his job by either signing the budget or returning it to us immediately with his veto then we will be damaging the lives of too many people in this state,” she said.\\n\\nSome Democrats have expressed a desire to work with the governor in eliminating the tax hike at issue in the bill.\\n\\n“Senate Minority Leader Troy Jackson, D-Allagash, said during a hastily organized news conference after the governor’s comments that he will personally introduce a bill to eliminate the proposed lodging tax increase if that would spur LePage and Republicans to support the budget bill, though Gideon said she wouldn’t support any changes late in the process. “If the governor has objections to the lodging tax, that’s fine,” Jackson said. “I will personally sponsor any bill he puts in that eliminates the increase in the lodging tax.”\\n\\nUnder a shutdown, Maine would have no authority to pay workers, meaning the state’s roughly 12,000 employees will either work or stay home without pay, LePage announced Thursday that state law enforcement, state parks, psychiatric hospitals, prisons and ferries will remain operational, but that was only a partial plan. During the state’s last shutdown, in 1991, 2,000 employees were called into work at the beginning of the shutdown.\\n\\nThe shutdown, though brief, could have a major impact on the state’s economy, according to BDN.\\n\\n“Workers represented by the Maine State Employees Association will lose wages generating $2.5 million in daily economic impact, according to an analysis from the liberal Maine Center for Economic Policy, with $944,000 in Kennebec County alone.”\\n\\nUncertainty surrounding whether state workers will be paid next week inspired a wave of protests at the capitol.\\n\\nSome of those union members were at the State House on Friday, including Kip Mitchell, 53, a Maine Department of Transportation employee who said he’s the only wage earner in a family of four who said “the uncertainty is scary.” Jonathan French, 38, of Hallowell, a civil engineer in the same department, said he had worries besides his job, since his young son gets services through the Maine Department of Education’s Child Development Services program. “We’re citizens, too, so we’re going to be out of work, but we’re also going to experience all the other effects of the shutdown … ,” he said. “So, it’s kind of a double-whammy for us.”\\n\\nTwo other states, Connecticut and Illinois, are struggling to pass budgets on Friday. Connecticut, which has seen its debt downgraded by all three of the major ratings agencies in recent months, is trying to winnow a $5 billion budget deficit that’s driven largely by overly generous benefits to state employees. Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy signed an executive order Friday afternoon to take control of state spending after the legislature was unable to reach a deal on the bienniel budget.\\n\\nIllinois, which has been operating without a budget for two years, could see its debt rating downgraded to junk territory if it fails to pass a budget. As the situation in Illinois appears increasingly uncertain, its house speaker has said he will ask the credit agencies to defer action based on progress being made toward an accord.\\n\\nRight.

Of course, Vladimir Putin has conditioned the asylum as follows:\\n\\n“If he wants to stay here, there is one condition: He must cease his work aimed at inflicting damage to our American partners, as strange as it may sound from my lips.”\\n\\nAfter bellicose statements that served only to embarrass the United Statements, the government of Ecuador has stated that it would consider granting asylum to Snowden subject to his setting-foot in Ecuador or an embassy thereof. Snowden could take a taxi to the Ecuadoran embassy in Moscow. Or could he? Clearly, Putin put Snowden \"in the freezer\". Isolated, with all options closed, Snowden appears to be making a deal Putin to avoid extradition to the US. Of course, the strings attached to this deal will be surrender of the NSA to the Russians.\\n\\nMost likely, the Russians already have the data. Glenn Greenwald will probably lose his \"exclusivity\".\\n\\nGlenn Greenwald and WikiLeaks carefully presented Snowden as a civil liberties patriot whose only intent was to protect the privacy of American citizens. Yet, Snowden has leaked stolen data that has served only to weaken relations with our closest allies. It would be naive to believe that the NSA information stolen by Snowden has not already fallen into the hands of Communist China and Russia.\\n\\nVladimir Putin, former head of the KGB, is a ruthless authoritarian. He is so concerned about the political freedom, justice and freedom of expression that he orchestrated a farce trial to imprison members of Pussy Riot, a punk rock band not to be confused with a viable political movement, for an act of protest that would not have been considered newsworthy in the United States.\\n\\nPresumably, representatives of WikiLeaks are counseling Snowden on his asylum petition. It is very possible that organization is complicit in Snowden\\'s theft of the NSA data, and Greenwald\\'s careful personal promotion of the story is more akin to Judith Miller\\'s WMD reporting than Daniel Ellsberg\\'s Pentagon Papers.\\n\\nIf Snowden actually secures Russian asylum, then his crime is elevated beyond theft and espionage to a treasonous level. His actions will not reduce the amount of intelligence collected; rather, it will increase the need for it. He has inflicted serious damage upon the United States, and he has impaired the ability of the United States to serve as a world leader and arbiter of disputes.\\n\\nAs this story plays-out, it is likely that the officeholders who have publicly championed Snowden will conclude that they have played the fool. They will either back-off or pay the political price. The progressive community faces the same dilemma.',\n",

If we don\\'t get smart it will only get worse,” he tweeted just after 7am ET on Sunday as the world reeled from the third deadly terrorist attack in the UK in less than three months.\\n\\nWe must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we don\\'t get smart it will only get worse — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2017\\n\\nTrump also mocked London Mayor Sadiq Khan\\'s appeal for calm: \"At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is \\'no reason to be alarmed!\\' \" Trump said in a subsequent tweet.\\n\\nAt least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is \"no reason to be alarmed!\" — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2017\\n\\n“This is our city… and we will never be cowed by terrorism,” Mayor Khan said during a statement in which he called those behind the attack “barbaric cowards.”\\n\\nIn a statement to the BBC, Khan said \"Londoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days. There\\'s no reason to be alarmed. One of the things the police and all of us need to do is ensure that we\\'re as safe as we possibly can be,\" he continued.\\n\\nTrump also focused on the weapons used in the attack, pointing out the absence of guns used and the resulting lack of a \"gun debate\".\\n\\nDo you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That\\'s because they used knives and a truck! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2017\\n\\nLate on Saturday, when details of the terrorist attack first emerged Trump renewed his call for the courts to approve his executive order banning travel from six Muslim-majority countries prompting a harsh response from his critics who accused him of using a tragedy for promoting his political agenda.\\n\\n\"We need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights,\" Trump tweeted. \"We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\"\\n\\nWe need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2017\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump last week petitioned the Supreme Court to reconsider the legality of his travel ban. The DOJ spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement the department had \"asked the Supreme Court to hear this important case and [is] confident that President Trump\\'s executive order is well within his lawful authority to keep the nation safe and protect our communities from terrorism.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nMeanwhile, Theresa May appeared to side with Trump, when she called for the country to unite after Saturday\\'s attack, saying can not \"pretend that things can continue as they are.\"\\n\\n\"We cannot and must not pretend that things can continue as they are. Things need to change,\" May said in a statement Sunday. May said the recent attacks in England are bound together \"by the single, evil ideology of Islamist extremism that preaches hatred, sows division and promotes sectarianism.\"\\n\\n\"Defeating that ideology is one of the great challenges of our time.\" May added that the ideology cannot be given the \"safe space it needs to breed.\"\\n\\nThe Prime Minister also said Britain\\'s counter-terrorism strategy must be reviewed due to \"what we are learning about the changing threat.\"\\n\\n\"Since the emergence of the threat from Islamist-inspired terrorism, our country has made significant progress in disrupting plots and protecting the public,\" she said. \"But it is time to say enough is enough. Everybody needs to go about their lives as they normally would. Our society should continue to function in accordance with our values. But when it comes to taking on extremism and terrorism, things need to change.\"\\n\\nThe country\\'s response to the violence, she said, needs to be to unite. \"We must come together, we must pull together, and united we will take on and defeat our enemies.\"',\n",

His latest : Former Vice President Dick Cheney personally ran an \"executive assassination ring.\"Like every good tale, there is some truth to it. The Joint Special Operations Command, or JSOC, does participate in the black operations hunt for al Qaeda and other terrorist groups\\' leaders. This is done in conjunction with the CIA\\'s Special Activities Division. There is little secrecy about this, just read Jawbreaker or this article by Bob Woodward from back in November of 2001. But to claim that JSOC does not \"report to anybody, except in the Bush-Cheney days, they reported directly to the Cheney office,\" or that \"Congress has no oversight of it\" is just false. JSOC was established in 1980 after the failed mission to rescue the hostages at the U.S. embassy in Iran. JSOC is a component command of the U.S. Special Operations Command, which reports to the Secretary of Defense. JSOC, like the CIA, certainly falls under congressional oversight.

       " ('After contacting the congressional office of Justin Amash and expressing my interest in interviewing the 31-year-old libertarian Republican from Michigan, I received a terse reply via email from his press secretary.\\n\\n“Hi, Michael,” the email read. “Thanks for your patience. This won’t work for Rep. Amash right now.”\\n\\nThis, I’m told, is a common response. Amash (rhymes with “awash”) doesn’t give many interviews. Most of the time, inquiring journalists are directed to the freshman member’s Facebook page, where they can find his educational history (University of Michigan, A.B. 2002, J.D. 2005), his religious views (Christian), and his extensive résumé (see the “About Me” screenshot below).\\n\\nAmash writes and edits the page himself, often from the House floor on his iPad. That level of openness and transparency may help explain his impressive number of Facebook fans: over 32,000 and rising. He posts everything from photos of his inflight reading (recently, Hayek on Hayek, a volume from the collected works of Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek) to videos of his speeches on the floor of the House. He updates seven days a week, at all hours of the day and night.\\n\\nBut Amash mostly uses his Facebook page to chronicle his work for the people of his district. He writes and publishes an explanation for nearly every vote he takes, which is a lot of explaining, since he hasn’t missed a vote since entering Congress.\\n\\nAt 11:11 a.m. on June 2, for example, Amash wrote that he voted for an amendment, authored by Jeff Duncan of South Carolina, to H.R. 4310. The amendment, he wrote, “bars funds for implementation of the Law of the Sea treaty. Among other things, the treaty includes a tax and redistribution scheme that covers resources in the continental shelf. It passed 229-193.” At 11:13, Lynette Largent commented, “Yesss! Whoot!” A few minutes later, Joseph Benning wrote, “Yeah! This diabolical LOST is a genuine threat to our sovereignty.” Amash’s post received 119 “likes” and 19 comments, all laudatory.\\n\\nThe commenters aren’t just constituents from Amash’s Grand Rapids-area district—their profiles show them to be as far-flung as Georgia and Alaska. The district was once represented by Gerald Ford and usually elects Republicans. Amash’s immediate predecessor was Vern Ehlers, a research physicist who retired in 2010 after 18 years in the House and had a reputation for moderate, inoffensive Republicanism and competent constituent service. Grand Rapidians aren’t used to being represented by fierce ideologues. But if Republicans in the district are at all unhappy with having a libertarian loner in Congress, they haven’t shown it; Amash was unopposed in this year’s GOP primary.\\n\\nWhat is clear is that the majority of Amash’s Facebook interlocutors share his interest in Austrian economics, libertarian philosophy, and the politics of Ron Paul. In fact, Amash may be more the true heir to the elder Paul’s libertarian throne than his son Rand Paul, the Kentucky senator (and Romney endorser).\\n\\nLike the veteran member from Texas, Amash has voted against the Republican caucus on more than 80 bills. He often votes against small, noncontroversial spending bills: federal assistance to state and local police forces, research funds for cybersecurity, additional appropriations for the Department of Veterans Affairs. A member of the House Budget Committee, Amash supported the Paul Ryan-authored budget in 2011 but voted against the nearly identical budget in 2012, saying that while it was, “in most respects, better than last year’s,” the 2012 cuts weren’t deep enough, particularly in the area of military spending and foreign aid.\\n\\nAn ardent civil libertarian as well as a fiscal one, Amash doesn’t just oppose this year’s National Defense Authorization Act—he coauthored an amendment with liberal Democrat Adam Smith of Washington that would have ended the military’s practice of detaining American citizens accused of terrorism. (The Amash-Smith amendment failed.) And Amash alone among Republicans joined eight very liberal Democrats in opposing a House resolution reaffirming the nation’s motto as “In God We Trust.”\\n\\nHouse Republicans call him the “black sheep” of the conference, and Amash does seem to have an unscratchable itch to buck his own party. Take a recent bill designed to restore the flow of water to California’s Central Valley. A court ruling in 2009 halted the flow under the Endangered Species Act—the irrigation system supposedly harmed a species of smelt. Ten moderate Democrats joined 236 Republicans to give the drought-ridden Central Valley access to its water supply, with Amash the only Republican opposed. There’s no explanation for this vote on his Facebook page.\\n\\n“He is a well-intentioned guy with very different goals than most people up here,” said one House Republican aide. “He’s not interested in governing.”\\n\\nOr even in engaging with his House colleagues. When I asked fellow freshman Republican Renee Ellmers of North Carolina about Amash, she laughed nervously. “He doesn’t play nice with others,” said Ellmers, a Tea Party conservative popular with the House leadership. “The thing is, he is a member who represents his constituency, and he has a”—she paused to think—“a different perspective.”\\n\\nFor the Republican establishment, Amash may be more an amusing spectacle than a serious threat. After the first ask, the GOP leadership doesn’t bother whipping Amash on votes. Committee chairs have learned he’s not likely to budge and usually don’t try to negotiate with him. No congressman is an island, but Amash comes close.\\n\\nA few days after his office rejected my interview request, I happened to spot Amash walking by himself on Pennsylvania Avenue, across the street from the Capitol.\\n\\n“Congressman,” I said, introducing myself. He looked startled and confused, as if most passersby in D.C. assume he’s a midlevel congressional staffer. I told him about my fruitless efforts to snag an interview with him.\\n\\n“Well, um,” he said, “it’s been a crazy week.” He referred me back to his office and walked away without saying much else. Probably off to do important things congressmen do, I figured.\\n\\nLater that afternoon, though, there was only one new update on Amash’s Facebook page—a brief birthday message for French libertarian economist Frédéric Bastiat. According to Facebook, “511 people like this.”\\n\\nMichael Warren is a reporter at The Weekly Standard.\\n\\nCorrection: Amash does have an explanation for his vote against restoring water to the Central Valley, available on his Facebook page.',\n",

Aggregate household debt increased for the 12th consecutive quarter, and are now $164 billion higher than the previous peak of $12.68 trillion set in Q3, 2008. As of June 30, 2017, total household indebtedness was $12.84 trillion, or 69% of US GDP: a $114 billion (0.9%) increase from the first quarter of 2017 and up $552 billion from a year ago. Overall household debt is now 15.1% above the Q2 2013 trough.\\n\\nMortgage balances, the largest component of household debt, increased again during the first quarter to $8.69 trillion, an increase of $64 billion from the first quarter of 2017. Balances on home equity lines of credit (HELOC) were roughly flat, and now stand at $452 billion. Non-housing balances were up in the second quarter. Auto loans grew by $23 billion and credit card balances increased by $20 billion, while student loan balances were roughly flat.\\n\\nConfirming the slowdown in mortgage activity, mortgage originations in Q2 declined to $421 billion from $491 billion. Meanwhile, there were $148 billion in auto loan originations in the second quarter of 2017, an uptick from the first quarter and about the same as the very high level in the 2nd quarter of 2016 .\\n\\nfrom the first quarter . Auto loan balances increased by $23 billion, continuing their 6-year trend. Auto loan delinquency rates increased slightly, with 3.9% of auto loan balances 90 or more days delinquent on June 30. The aggregate credit card limit rose for the 18h consecutive quarter, with a 1.6% increase.\\n\\nOutstanding student loan balances rose modestly, and stood at $1.34 trillion as of June 30, 2017. The second quarter typically witnesses slow or no growth in student loan balances due to the academic cycle. As discussed previously, a perilously high 11.2% of aggregate student loan debt was 90+ days delinquent or in default in 2017 Q2.\\n\\nIn a troubling development, the report noted that the distribution of the credit scores of newly originating mortgage and auto loan borrowers shifted downward somewhat, as the median score for originating borrowers for auto loans dropped 8 points to 698, and the median origination score for mortgages declined to 754. For now this credit score decline has not impacted the credit market: about 85,000 individuals had a new foreclosure notation added to their credit reports in the second quarter as foreclosures remained low by historical standards.\\n\\nAnd while much of the report was in line with recent trends, and the overall debt that was delinquent, at 4.8%, was on par with the previous quarters, the NY Fed did issue a red flag warning over the transitions of credit card balances into delinquency, which the New York Fed said \"ticked up notably.\"\\n\\nDiscussing the troubling deterioration in credit card defaults, first pointed out here in April, the New York Fed said that credit card balance flows into both early and serious delinquencies increased from a year ago, describing this as \"a persistent upward movement not seen since 2009.\" As shown in the chart below, the transition into 30 and 90-Day delinquencies has, over the past two quarters, surged to the highest rate since the first quarter of 2013, suggesting something drastically changed in the last three quarters when it comes to US consumer behavior.\\n\\n“While relatively low, credit card delinquency flows climbed notably over the past year,” said Andrew Haughwout, senior vice president at the New York Fed. “This is occurring within the context of loosening lending standards, as borrowers with lower credit scores recover their ability to access credit cards. The current state of credit card delinquency flows can be an early indicator of future trends and we will closely monitor the degree to which this uptick is predictive of further consumer distress.”\\n\\nThat bolded statement, is the first official warning by the Fed that the US consumer is sick, and the Fed has no way reasonable explanation for this troubling jump in delinquencies. Timestamp it, because this will certainly not the be the last time the Fed warns about the dangerous consequences of all-time high credit card debt.\\n\\nAs for the \"further uptick in consumer distress\", we are just guessing but the fact that credit card defaults are jumping at a time when sales at fast food and other restaurants have declined for 17 consecutive quarters, and when $250 billion in US household savings was just \"revised\" away, may all be connected.',\n",

No, this time it’s not about Global Warming, which made him a multi-millionaire overnight.\\n\\nIn 2000, then Vice-President Al Gore had a net worth of $1-2 million. By 2008 — after winning a Nobel Peace prize and an Academy Award, numerous $175,000 speaking gigs, $35 million stock in Google and Apple that he received as a board advisor, and ownership of a carbon credit trading company — his net worth ballooned to $120 million, an increase of 6,000% to 12,000%!\\n\\nNow, the “fat crazed sex poodle” is calling Americans to rise up in rebellion, à la the Arab Spring that began in Egypt. But wait. Gore means only certain Americans — his kind of Americans.\\n\\nThe other night on his Current TV, Gore said to former MSNBC loudmouth Keith Olbermann that America needs to work toward an “reinvigoration of democracy”:\\n\\n“We need to have an American spring. You know, the Arab Spring—the nonviolent part of it isn’t finished yet—but we need to have an American Spring, a kind of an American Tahrir Square. Non-violent change, where people from the grassroots get involved again. I want to tell you, Keith, this country is in trouble. Our democracy has been withering on the vine, it really has been. This has been going on for some time. But this is not an event that can be taken lately. I know it’s difficult to imagine that the people who care about the values that this country was based on will rise up and get much more involved in the democratic process, but that is exactly what we need and that is the only thing that can get our country back on the right track. ”\\n\\nDaniel Halper of the Weekly Standard asks a question that’s on our minds as well:\\n\\n“Was the former vice president of the United States actually suggesting that Barack Obama is like an Arab tyrant who is responsible for the murder of thousands of his own citizens (just like Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad)?”\\n\\nThen, Gore hastily made clear that his American Spring has no room for the TEA Party — a genuine grassroots movement that arose after the 2008 election, credited with confronting members of Congress in townhall meetings across America in the summer of 2009, and with the million-patriots March on Washington, DC, on September 12, 2009:\\n\\nNoooooo. Those are not the Americans Gore has in mind for his “American Spring”! This is what he said to Olbermann:\\n\\n“Not in the Tea Party style…that movement was funded with seed money from right-wing billionaires, the Koch brothers, and promoted on Fox News and turned into a stalking horse for this right-wing agenda that a lot of people have been trying to push on this country for a long time….”\\n\\nYesiree! When those hundreds and thousands of ordinary Americans showed up in town hall meetings and marched on D.C., they were just puppets of the dastardly Koch brothers, like these two sweet grandmothers:\\n\\nSo Al Gore now thinks the Tea Party is the bane of America.

The whistleblower is now fearful for his life. Along with the lives of other unarmed TSA personnel, his life would be in grave danger were an airport checkpoint shooting to unfold. He said: “Every day when I arrive for work, I look for an escape route in case someone opens fire.

In addition to the 1.6 billion bullets, mostly jacketed hollow points, which the DHS had purchased, Examiner.com reports, Jan. 28, 2013, that DHS just put in a bid to purchase 7,000 assault weapons — select fire or automatic AR-15 rifles.\\n\\nLike Congress and other government officials and agencies, DHS is exempted from Sen. Feinstein’s “assault weapons” ban bill.\\n\\nIn his Washington Times article, Jones also makes mention of something I had not known: The “underwear bomber” incident on Christmas Day 2009 may have been a “false flag” event by the Obama regime’s Homeland Security.\\n\\nThere are eyewitness reports, including one by Michigan attorney Kurt Haskell, a 2012 Democratic Congressional candidate who lost to incumbent Tim Walberg (R-MI), that DHS knew that “underwear bomber” Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian, was a threat to air safety. Despite that, Abdulmutallab was seen being assisted by “a well-dressed man” who helped the Nigerian terrorist board Northwest Airlines flight 253 without a passport.\\n\\nRead the rest of Jones’ Washington Times article here.\\n\\nI don’t know what this reported TSA training means: Is DHS sounding a warning to its TSA agents, knowing that there will be a “false flag” mass shooting incident at some airport?

       " ('All Mac iOS devices and systems are exposed and vulnerable to the recently discovered chip bugs known as Spectre and Meltdown, Apple confirmed on Thursday. The flaws, which as we discussed before, allow hackers unauthorized access to a computer’s memory and sensitive data, were discovered by security researchers at Google Project Zero on Wednesday. Security vulnerabilities called Meltdown and Spectre affect almost all modern CPUs, including those produced by Intel, AMD and ARM Holdings.\\n\\n“All Mac systems and iOS devices are affected,” Apple acknowledged in a statement on Thursday, adding that no cases had yet been reported of customers being affected by the security flaws.\\n\\nTo address these security vulnerabilities, Apple users may have noticed a suspiciously timed software update released earlier this week for their iPads, MacBooks and iPhones – an update that appeared to precede news about the latest controversy involving makers of microprocessors. Intel, one of the world’s largest chipmakers, admitted that its chips contain a flaw making it easier for hackers to hoover up sensitive information like the owner’s passwords. It was later revealed that this flaw wasn’t exclusive to Intel’s chips: Indeed, it reportedly affects nearly all microprocessors in circulation, according to the New York Times.\\n\\nHere’s a succinct explanation of the problems that we published earlier this week:\\n\\n4. We\\'re dealing with two serious threats. The first is isolated to #IntelChips, has been dubbed Meltdown, and affects virtually all Intel microprocessors. The patch, called KAISER, will slow performance speeds of processors by as much as 30 percent. 5. The second issue is a fundamental flaw in processor design approach, dubbed Spectre, which is more difficult to exploit, but affects virtually ALL PROCESSORS ON THE MARKET (Note here: Intel stock went down today but Spectre affects AMD and ARM too), and has NO FIX.\\n\\nUsers may have been wary after reading last month about Apple admitting what was long suspected by many loyal customers: That the company intentionally engineers software updates to slow down older products, thereby hastening the cycle of planned obsolescence that has helped establish Apple as the world’s most valuable company.\\n\\nBut as it turns out, the software update was designed to try and plug some of the security holes resulting from Intel’s Meltdown flaw.\\n\\nSpecifically, Apple issued updates for the iOS 11.2, macOS 10.13.2 and tvOS 11.2 systems to protect against Meltdown, which the company believes “has the most potential to be exploited.”\\n\\nAccording to Bloomberg, despite concern that fixes may slow down devices, Apple said its update to address the Meltdown issue haven’t dented performance. The company will release an update to its Safari web browser in coming days to defend against the Spectre flaw described above.\\n\\nAs noted, while Macs and iOS devices are vulnerable to Spectre attacks through code that can run in web browsers, Apple said it would issue a patch to its Safari web browser for those devices \"in the coming days.\" However, Apple said these steps could slow the speed of the browser by less than 2.5%.\\n\\nThe updates affected all iPads, iPhones, iPod touches, Mac desktops and laptops, and the Apple TV set-top-box. The Apple Watch, which runs a derivative of the iPhone’s operating system is not affected, according to the company.\\n\\nBrowser makers Google, Microsoft Corp and Mozilla Corp’s Firefox all told Reuters that the patches they currently have in place do not protect iOS users. With Safari and virtually all other popular browsers not patched, hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users may have no secure means of browsing the web until Apple issues its patch.\\n\\nAmazing: Mozilla confirms that the leak attack can be exploited from JavaScript. Update your browsers too. https://t.co/segMcZvBEs — Miguel de Icaza (@migueldeicaza) January 4, 2018\\n\\nStill, some customers were angry at tight-lipped Apple PR’s reticence on the issue following the revelations about the chip flaws earlier this week.\\n\\nBen Johnson, co-founder and chief strategist for cyber security firm Carbon Black, said the delay in updating customers about whether Apple’s devices are at risk could affect Apple’s drive to get more business customers to adopt its hardware.\\n\\n“Something this severe gets the attention of all the employees and executives at a company, and when they go asking the IT and security people about it and security doesn’t have an answer for iPhones and iPads, it just doesn’t give a whole lot of confidence,” Johnson said.\\n\\nFinally, Apple stressed that there were no known instances of hackers taking advantage of the flaw to date. For Apple\\'s sake this better remain the case or else sellside analysts may just have to lower their iPhone sales forecasts for the foreseeable future.',\n",

       " ('All over America there are millions of people that will be missing meals and going hungry this holiday season. Even as much of the country indulges in the yearly ritual of unbridled consumerism that we refer to as “the holiday season”, more families in the United States than ever before will be dealing with not having enough food to eat. Food stamp use is at an all-time high. Demand at food banks is at an all-time high. They keep telling us that we are in an “economic recovery” and yet the middle class continues to shrink and the number of Americans living in poverty just continues to grow. We are witnessing unprecedented hunger in America, and this especially seems tragic during the holidays. Much of the country is partying as if the good times will never stop, but families that are living from one meal to the next are facing a completely different reality. How do you tell your children that there isn’t going to be any food to eat for dinner? How do you explain to them that other families have plenty to eat but you don’t? Sadly, many food banks are overstretched at this point. All over the nation, food pantries have actually had to turn people away because of the overwhelming demand. And more Americans used food stamps to buy their Thanksgiving dinners this year than ever before. This is a problem that is not going away any time soon, and when the next major economic downturn strikes the problem of hunger in America is going to get even worse.\\n\\nFor many Americans, hunger has become a way of life. Families that don’t have enough money are often faced with some absolutely heartbreaking choices. Just check out what one Maine official that works with the Emergency Food Assistance Program recently had to say…\\n\\n“One in six people in Maine don’t know where their next meal is coming from, or skip a meal so their kids can eat, or have to choose between paying for prescriptions and food, or fuel for your car and food,” Hall said. “What’s amazing is that food is always the first thing to go from your budget. It’s staggering, the choices people have to make.”\\n\\nFood banks all over the country try their best to do what they can, especially during the holidays, but it is often not enough. In fact, some food banks ran out of turkeys well in advance of Thanksgiving this year…\\n\\nThree days in advance of Thanksgiving, the Pear Street Cupboard and Café in Framingham, Massachusetts, is out of turkeys. According to organizers, “requests for help are up 400 percent over last year.”\\n\\nBut it isn’t just during the holidays that food banks are having problems keeping up with demand. The truth is that many food banks find themselves out of food and having to turn away hungry families all throughout the year. The following is from a recent Reuters article…\\n\\nOverall, food pantries and soup kitchens reported a 5 percent spike in demand in 2012, according to the survey. More than half of providers said they were forced to turn away clients, reduce portion sizes, or limit their hours. In Staten Island, all of the agencies that respond to hunger reported not having enough food to meet demand, while in the Bronx that was true for 80 percent of agencies. In Queens and Brooklyn, more than 60 percent of agencies did not have enough food to meet the needs of the populations they serve.\\n\\nIf you are able, please support your local food bank. The needs are great and they are only going to get greater.\\n\\nThe following are 20 facts about hunger in America that will blow your mind…\\n\\n#1 According to one calculation, the number of Americans on food stamps now exceeds the combined populations of “Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.”\\n\\n#2 In October 2008, 30.8 million Americans were on food stamps. By August 2012 that number had risen to 47.1 million Americans.\\n\\n#3 Right now, one out of every seven Americans is on food stamps and one out of every four American children is on food stamps.\\n\\n#4 It is projected that half of all American children will be on food stamps at least once before they turn 18 years of age.\\n\\n#5 According to new numbers that were just released by the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of Americans living in poverty increased to a new all-time record high of 49.7 million last year.\\n\\n#6 The number of Americans living in poverty has increased by about 6 million over the past four years.\\n\\n#7 Today, about one out of every four workers in the United States brings home wages that are at or below the federal poverty level.\\n\\n#8 According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the poverty rate for children living in the United States is about 22 percent.\\n\\n#9 Overall, approximately 57 percent of all children in the United States are living in homes that are either considered to be either “low income” or impoverished.\\n\\n#10 In the United States today, close to 100 million Americans are considered to be either “poor” or “near poor”.\\n\\n#11 One university study estimates that child poverty costs the U.S. economy 500 billion dollars each year.\\n\\n#12 Households that are led by a single mother have a 31.6 percent poverty rate.\\n\\n#13 In 2010, 42 percent of all single mothers in the United States were on food stamps.\\n\\n#14 According to the National Center for Children in Poverty, 36.4 percent of all children in Philadelphia are living in poverty, 40.1 percent of all children in Atlanta are living in poverty, 52.6 percent of all children in Cleveland are living in poverty and 53.6 percent of all children in Detroit are living in poverty.\\n\\n#15 Since 2007, the number of children living in poverty in the state of California has increased by 30 percent.\\n\\n#16 Family homelessness in the Washington D.C. region (one of the wealthiest regions in the entire country) has risen 23 percent since the last recession began.\\n\\n#17 There are 314 counties in the United States where at least 30 percent of the children are facing food insecurity.\\n\\n#18 More than 20 million U.S. children rely on school meal programs to keep from going hungry.\\n\\n#19 Right now, more than 100 million Americans are enrolled in at least one welfare program run by the federal government. And that does not even count Social Security or Medicare.\\n\\n#20 According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, approximately 40 percent of all food in America “is routinely thrown away by consumers at home, discarded or unserved at restaurants or left unharvested on farms.”',\n",

       " ('Although Texas has previously cut Planned Parenthood off from Medicaid reimbursements, a federal district court ruled last month that the organization’s 30 health centers serving about 12,500 Medicaid patients in the state can continue to do so and must be reimbursed.\\n\\nThat’s good news because the state’s effort to get other clinics to fill in for Planned Parenthood through funding the work of a hardcore anti-abortion activist hasn’t worked out very well.\\n\\nPaul J. Weber at the Austin American-Statesman reports:\\n\\nLast summer, Texas gave $1.6 million to an anti-abortion organization called the Heidi Group to help strengthen small clinics that specialize in women\\'s health like Planned Parenthood but don\\'t offer abortions. The goal was to help the clinics boost their patient rolls and show there would be no gap in services if the nation\\'s largest abortion provider had to scale back. But eight months later, the Heidi Group has little to show for its work. An Associated Press review found the nonprofit has done little of the outreach it promised, such as helping clinics promote their services on Facebook, or airing public service announcements. It hasn\\'t made good on plans to establish a 1-800 number to help women find providers or ensure that all clinics have updated websites. [...] \"Every time they try to relaunch one of these women\\'s health programs, without some of the most trusted providers in women\\'s health, every single time they come up short,\" said Sarah Wheat, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman in Texas. \"And they show their lack of understanding and respect for what women need.\"\\n\\nThe situation with the Heidi Group isn’t unique.\\n\\nJoseph Potter, the main investigator for the Texas Policy Evaluation Project, looked into the state legislature’s decision in 2011, 2013, and 2015 to dump Planned Parenthood from Medicaid reimbursements. The bottom line of his investigation? Many clinics supposedly on the list of those that would fill in for Planned Parenthood aren’t interested in doing so. As a consequence, “fewer have received contraceptive services, fewer use highly effective methods, some have had unintended pregnancies, and some have had abortions they would not have had if not for these policies,” Potter wrote.\\n\\nOther states that have sought to cut off Medicaid reimbursements for Planned Parenthood have seen associated problems for women’s health as well.\\n\\nIt’s not hard to see why. Sara Rosenbaum, a professor at George Washington University\\'s School of Public Health and Health Services, wrote that the \"claim that community health centers readily can absorb the loss of Planned Parenthood clinics amounts to a gross misrepresentation of what even the best community health centers in the country would be able to do\":\\n\\nIt is important to set the record straight about what it would mean to women were health centers suddenly to have to respond to a hole in care of this magnitude, especially given absurd claims about their financial ability to do so, such as assertions that community health centers could do so for $1.67 per patient. Community health centers are extremely efficient, but the cost of caring for their patients averages about $600 per person annually.\\n\\nIn Indiana, after Planned Parenthood’s reimbursements were cut off in 2011 and five of the organization’s clinics were forced to shut their doors, HIV infections exploded in Scott County. The clinic there, which did not provide abortions, had been the only one in the county testing for HIV.\\n\\nIt all adds up to prove the oft-stated claim of forced-birthers that the array of hundreds of pieces of anti-abortion legislation they have pushed in state after state is meant to protect women’s health is a grotesque lie. And a lethal one.',\n",

       " ('America absolutely loves Wal-Mart. 100 million customers visit Wal-Mart every single week in this country. But is Wal-Mart good for America? That is a question that most people never stop and ask. Most of us love shopping in big, clean stores that are packed with super cheap merchandise, but the truth is that Wal-Mart is destroying America in a lot of ways. As you will see below, Wal-Mart has destroyed tens of thousands of small businesses and countless manufacturing jobs over the past couple of decades. Wal-Mart has become a gigantic retail behemoth that sells five times more stuff than any other retailer in the United States. Unfortunately, a large percentage of all the stuff sold at Wal-Mart is made overseas. What that is costing the U.S. economy in terms of lost jobs and lost revenue is incalculable. But Wal-Mart is a perfect example of where our economic system is headed. Our economy is becoming completely and totally dominated by highly centralized monolithic predator corporations that ruthlessly crush all competition and that will stoop to just about anything in order to cut costs. In the future, will we all be working for gigantic communal entities that funnel all of the wealth and economic rewards to a very tiny elite? That sounds very much like how communist China works, and red-blooded Americans should want no part of that. America is supposed to be about free enterprise and competition and working together to build up this country, and Wal-Mart is destroying all of that.\\n\\nThe following are 20 facts about Wal-Mart that will absolutely shock you….\\n\\n#1 The average U.S. family now spends more than $4000 a year at Wal-Mart.\\n\\n#2 In 2010, Wal-Mart had revenues of 421 billion dollars. That amount was greater than the GDP of 170 different countries including Norway, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates.\\n\\n#3 If Wal-Mart was a nation, it would have the 23rd largest GDP in the world.\\n\\n#4 Wal-Mart now sells more groceries than anyone else in America does. In the United States today, one out of every four grocery dollars is spent at Wal-Mart.\\n\\n#5 Amazingly, 100 million customers shop at Wal-Mart every single week.\\n\\n#6 Wal-Mart has opened more than 1,100 “supercenters” since 2005 alone.\\n\\n#7 Today, Wal-Mart has more than 2 million employees.\\n\\n#8 If Wal-Mart was an army, it would be the second largest military on the planet behind China.\\n\\n#9 Wal-Mart is the largest employer in 25 different U.S. states.\\n\\n#10 According to the Economic Policy Institute, trade between Wal-Mart and China resulted in the loss of 133,000 manufacturing jobs in the United States between 2001 and 2006.\\n\\n#11 The CEO of Wal-Mart makes more in a single hour than a full-time Wal-Mart associate makes in an entire year.\\n\\n#12 Tens of thousands of Wal-Mart employees and their children are enrolled in Medicaid and are dependent on the government for healthcare.\\n\\n#13 Between 2001 and 2007, the value of products that Wal-Mart imported from China grew from $9 billion to $27 billion.\\n\\n#14 Amazingly, 96 percent of all Americans now live within 20 miles of a Wal-Mart.\\n\\n#15 The number of “independent retailers” in the United States declined by 60,000 between 1992 and 2007.\\n\\n#16 According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Wal-Mart spent 7.8 million dollars on political lobbying during 2011. That number does not even include campaign contributions.\\n\\n#17 Today, Wal-Mart has five times the sales of the second largest U.S. retailer (Costco).\\n\\n#18 The combined net worth of six members of the Walton family is roughly equal to the combined net worth of the poorest 30 percent of all Americans.\\n\\nAll over the country, independent retailers are going out of business because they cannot compete with Wal-Mart and their super cheap Chinese products. Often communities will give Wal-Mart huge tax breaks just to move in to their areas. But what many communities don’t take into account is that the introduction of a Wal-Mart is often absolutely devastating to small businesses….\\n\\nA study of small and rural towns in Iowa showed lost sales for local businesses ranging from -17.2% in small towns to -61.4% in rural areas, amounting to a total dollar loss of $2.46 BILLION over a 13-year period.\\n\\nWhen we buy stuff made by people working for slave labor wages in China, we destroy good paying American jobs and we make America poorer. This is a point that I have tried to make over and over.\\n\\nWal-Mart often tells one thing to the public and then does another thing in private. Sadly, the truth is that Wal-Mart does not care about U.S. manufacturing jobs. Wal-Mart just wants to get products as cheaply as they possibly can, and most of the time that means getting them from China.\\n\\nJust check out this first-hand testimony from an 81-year-old retired apparel manufacturer….\\n\\nI was president of the Southwestern Apparel Manufacturers Association. There was a meeting sometime between 1985 and 1990. Walmart had contacted our organization and asked if they could meet with us at our beautiful Apparel Mart we had here in Dallas, which has now been razed, because all the independent merchants don’t exist that used to come to it. Two people from Walmart came down and they said they were going to be sourcing goods from overseas and we would have to meet those prices for consumer products and to get ready for it—we are going to be sourcing the world. Walmart was the only company that came out and said this. It was sort of shocking: I was selling them some merchandise at the time. On the back of their trucks it was saying “Bring it Back to America!” They had the big “keep it in America” program going at that time on the big signs in the stores. Meanwhile when I reminded the buyer of that, she told me, “that is just for domestic consumption, we’re going to buy at the cheapest we can anywhere on earth.”\\n\\nAs I have written about previously, the United States has lost more than 56,000 manufacturing facilities since 2001.\\n\\nWe are losing millions of good jobs that cannot be replaced. If you can believe it, the United States has actually lost an average of about 50,000 manufacturing jobs a month since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.\\n\\nLast year, the U.S. trade deficit with China was the biggest trade deficit that one nation has had with another nation in the history of the world, and Wal-Mart played a huge role in that.\\n\\nIn fact, Wal-Mart has actually been forcing some U.S. manufacturers to pack up and move overseas. The following is from a recent article by Amy Traub….\\n\\nWalmart’s market power is so immense that the even the largest suppliers must comply with its demands for lower and lower prices because they cannot afford to have their goods taken off its shelves. Companies that used to manufacture products in the United States, from Levi’s jeans to lock maker Master Lock, were pressured to shut their U.S. factories and moved manufacturing abroad to meet Walmart’s demand for low prices.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the vast wealth that Wal-Mart is sucking out of our communities is not put back into our communities. The profits are funneled out to Wal-Mart executives and shareholders. We may enjoy the low prices, but very little of the money that we give to Wal-Mart gets recycled in our local areas.\\n\\nIn the old days, you could actually support a family selling electronics or running a general store. But you can’t support a family working at Wal-Mart. The vast majority of the jobs that Wal-Mart creates are very low paying. Large numbers of Wal-Mart employees are actually on welfare, and this is part of the reason why we have seen such an explosion in the number of the working poor in America.\\n\\nAt this point, more than 40 percent of all jobs in America are low wage jobs and the middle class is rapidly disappearing.\\n\\nIf we do not support American jobs and American manufacturers they will continue to go away and the welfare rolls in this country will continue to explode.\\n\\nThere is not going to be any prosperity in this country without jobs. Unfortunately, most Americans simply do not understand how good jobs are being systematically destroyed in America every single day.\\n\\nThe path that America is headed on today is only going to end in complete and total disaster. We are being transformed from a wealthy nation into a poor nation. In the end, we will be dominated by a very tiny elite and everyone else will either be among the working poor or will be totally dependent on the government.\\n\\nOur system is supposed to be about open, honest competition. But that is not what Wal-Mart is about. Wal-Mart is about crushing small businesses and manufacturers here in America and getting us all to buy their super cheap Chinese-made goods.\\n\\nSo what do all of you think about Wal-Mart?

But the basic rules of the game are the same. Three strikes, you\\'re out. You win elections by being the guy people want to be buddies with.\\n\\nIt drives me nuts every time Bill Maher brings up how stupid the American people were for voting for the guy they wanted to have a beer with in W over first Gore, then Kerry. Let me posit this query - who had more charisma, Barack Obama or John McCain? Bill Clinton or Bob Dole? Clinton or HW? Ronald Reagan or either of his two opponents? Jimmy Carter or Gerald Ford? Nixon had the deep manly voice and the authoritarian disposition that people wanted out of a leader in 1968, when the world seemed to be going crazy, but that wasn\\'t what folks were looking for 8 years earlier, when he got beaten by one of the most natural politicians in American History. Jack was Mickey Mantle. Eisenhower or Stevenson? The only presidential election in the last 50 years where the winner of the general election was not clearly the more charismatic candidate was Bush over Dukakis, where neither candidate had any real charisma whatsoever, and so America gave the Republicans the tiebreaker because they still liked Reagan so much. Reagan, by the way, was Reggie Jackson.\\n\\n(And by the way, don\\'t think for a second voters everywhere else don\\'t pull the same stupid shit.

W was always smiling and goofing around - people like a guy who enjoys himself. Do you really think Mitt Romney won anybody over to his side, carrying on the way he did last night? Was anybody watching Mitt Romney act like an enormous prick for an hour and a half thinking to themselves, \"yeah, that\\'s the guy I want in charge\", who wasn\\'t already thinking that before?\\n\\nSo I ask you again, Mitt Romney won the debate, really?\\n\\nAnd another thing - last night\\'s debate was not some independent event happening in a vacuum. In was the first in a series of four debates, which is in itself a part of the stretch run of the Presidential election. Whose to say the reason the President didn\\'t go on an all-out offensive last night wasn\\'t that he plans to lull Romney in in the first debate, and then come out firing in round 2, catching the guy off guard? Where was Bain Capital and the 47%? Well, maybe Obama wants to harp on that in the final debate, to make sure it\\'s fresh in everybody\\'s minds come Election Day, and he doesn\\'t want to be repeating it over and over again, because he doesn\\'t want the American people to think that personal attacks are all he\\'s got.\\n\\nThe pundits love their sports analogies, and so do I (I was a big fan of the one Rachael Maddow used last night, about how the debate was like a football game and Mitt dominated time of possession). So here\\'s one more:\\n\\nA Presidential Election is like a 12-round boxing match. And the debates are rounds 11 and 12. In a neck and neck match-up, they can make the difference in the final score. But if one of the two competitors has been getting his ass kicked from pillar to post all fight long, he can\\'t be trying to win the match on points. He needs to land a knock-out punch. And Mittens didn\\'t come anywhere close to anything like that.\\n\\nObama is still way ahead in Ohio. He\\'s still winning Florida, and Virginia. And New Hampshire. And Colorado. Nevada. Wisconsin. He still has that big 78 vote electoral bomb that\\'s gonna come down for him at 11:00 PM Eastern sharp, when polls close on the west coast & in Hawaii.\\n\\nObama is toying with Romney, right now, circling, dancing around, clutching and grabbing, waiting for the bell to ring. We\\'ll see if he comes out in round 12 like a bat out of hell and whips Romney\\'s ass like he did all summer. I hope he does, because Romney is such an asshole and it would be awesome to watch, but even if he just runs out the clock, he still gets to keep the belt.\\n\\nCHILL THE FUCK OUT!

       " ('Americans are sleep deprived. No one seems to be getting “enough” sleep, which scientists say should be 8 hours a night.\\n\\nNot only is chronic sleep deprivation hazardous — a contributing factor to traffic accidents — not getting enough sleep is also injurious to our health.\\n\\nEmily Yahr reports for the Washington Post, on the findings of the 2-hour “Sleepless in America,” a collaboration by NatGeo, National Institutes of Health (NIH) and The Public Good Projects:\\n\\n1. 40% of American adults are sleep-deprived: The average American sleeps less than 7 hours per night during the week, including 70% of adolescents.\\n\\n2. Reasons for Americans not getting enough sleep:\\n\\nOur constantly moving, overstimulated 24/7 society with so much technology and gadgetry that distracts everyone all the time.\\n\\nOverwork results in people not have enough time to do the things they want during the week. As a result, they stay up even later on weekends so they can compensate.\\n\\n3. Sleep is “just as important as good nutrition, physical activity and wearing your seatbelt”: Mark Rosekind, member of the National Transportation Safety Board, said: “Every aspect of who you are as a human, every capability is degraded, impaired, when you lose sleep. What does that mean? Your decision-making, reaction time, situational awareness, memory, communication, and those things go down by 20% to 50%.”\\n\\n4. Health effects of sleeping less than 7 hours a night include an increased risk for:\\n\\nObesity : An NIH study reduced subjects’ sleep to 4 hours a night and saw the impact on their weight. Turns out, sleeplessness increases an appetite for fatty foods, and the study showed that “short sleepers” consume 500 more calories a day than people who get enough sleep.\\n\\nDiabetes\\n\\ncardiovascular disease\\n\\nAlzheimer’s disease: When you sleep, the brain clears out toxic chemicals — and one of the proteins that accumulates in the brain while you’re awake is associated with Alzheimer’s disease.\\n\\nCancer\\n\\nMental diseases: Almost all mental illnesses have associated sleep problems, experts say. In fact, sleep deprivation is nearly universal in every psychiatric condition, from bipolar disorder to anxiety disorders. Studies show that high school students who sleep more have higher test scores and lower rates of depression\\n\\n5. The good news is that sleep can “inspire creativity, re-balance emotions, help refresh cardiovascular health, metabolic health and boost our immune system.”\\n\\nSo make getting 8 hours of sleep a night a priority!\\n\\n~Eowyn\\n\\nAdvertisements',\n",

       " ('Americans, particularly older Americans, continue to ignore the devastating effect that hackers can exert on one’s life. No matter how often they are warned to be vigilant about computer security, to erect firewalls to ensure that hackers do not infiltrate their PCs and steal credit card numbers, most folks blithely ignore these warnings and routinely go about their business. The results can be ruinous.\\n\\nI know, because that’s exactly what happened to me. But it doesn’t involve credit cards or bank account numbers; it involves the far more serious issue of intellectual property theft.\\n\\nIt started like this: You know how you sometimes come up with a great idea that you’re sure nobody else could have possibly thought of, like using homeless people as Wi-Fi hotspots or electing Al Franken to the Senate? And then somebody gets there ahead of you? That’s what happened to me with CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, based in Geneva.\\n\\nLast year, as many of you will recall, there was a big hubbub about Albert Einstein’s special theory of relativity. This erupted after a test run by CERN, using a device called the Icarus Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber, proved that neutrinos could travel faster than the speed of light. This meant that Einstein’s pivotal theory was wrong. Everybody in the press made a big deal about this, ridiculing Einstein left and right in the way that crass, snarky journalists so often will. Nature abhors a vacuum? Says who? E=mc²? My ass.\\n\\nThis glibness infuriated me, because I have been a fan of Einstein since my junior year in high school, when I did an oral report on his On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat, and supersmart Carol Petrowski agreed to dance with me. And if Einstein’s theory about the speed of light was wrong, it meant that everything we had believed about the universe for the past century was wrong.\\n\\nThe thing was: I knew all along that Einstein was right. I knew he was right because I have a scaled-down version of the Icarus Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber in my basement. I bought it at a yard sale last year when the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was unloading some old equipment at their annual rummage sale. Icarus Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers aren’t anywhere near as pricey as you would think—they’re sort of like iPods, where the manufacturer brings out a new model every year, so the discontinued models go fairly cheap.\\n\\nTo make a long story short, I set aside a weekend in January, re-ran the neutrino experiment down in the basement, and found that CERN’s data were all wrong. Without getting too technical about this, let’s just say that the knuckleheads in Switzerland miscalculated the vector of hydrotropic retro-fillibration—they were off by about an inch—and failed to allow for the impact of transmorpheal dysconfluence on the homeognomic panels that fuel the thalidomide crystals.\\n\\nIt was the kind of mistake you wouldn’t expect from the dumbest high school kid. The most important thing was that my work proved that Einstein, my hero, was right after all. Neutrinos cannot travel faster than the speed of light. Like, duh.\\n\\nHere’s where the story gets ugly. After I ran my experiment, I never got around to compiling my data and publishing my results because I came down with severe bronchitis, tore my meniscus, and had a few other personal issues to deal with. Well, a few months ago, CERN beat me to the punch with a report that last year’s experiment was a dud, that they’d run the test again, and it proved that Einstein was correct. Great news, right? Except that when I got hold of their report, I found language that sounded suspiciously similar to the wording in my report stored on my computer.\\n\\nNo, not similar: identical. Things like: “In the earlier study, technicians miscalculated the vector of hydrotropic retro-fillibration—they were off by about an inch—and failed to allow for the impact of transmorpheal dysconfluence on the homeognomic panels that fuel the thalidomide crystals.”\\n\\nYou don’t have to be Albert Einstein to figure out what had happened here. Somebody hacked into my laptop, shanghaied my data, re-ran the test, and proved that last year’s experiment was wrong. How could they know I was working on the project? Somebody at the Livermore laboratory must have spread the word that a hobbyist in Tarry\\xadtown, New York, had just snapped up a gently used Icarus Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber at their annual rummage sale. There aren’t that many of them around. Also, I talk about Einstein’s special theory of relativity a lot in my local diner, so anyone within earshot could have ripped me off.\\n\\nSome people may say I am being paranoid here, but I’m not. Because the neutrino incident wasn’t an isolated case. Not long ago, physicists announced that they had finally located the long sought-after Higgs Boson, a particle that endows other particles with mass. Big whoop. The fact is, I’ve got a dozen Higgs Bosons sitting in a bird feeder right outside my kitchen window. I was literally on the point of publishing my report on them when the scientists beat me to the punch and released their results.\\n\\nAnd where were those scientists from? The European Organization for Nuclear Research. That’s right, CERN. Coincidence, you say? I think not.\\n\\nJoe Queenan is the author, most recently, of Closing Time: A Memoir.',\n",

       " ('Amidst the flickering light of a dimming western civilization, some Europeans seem finally to be waking up to Creeping Islamization. But it’s likely too little, too late. But it’s not too late for America!\\n\\nWarning: The following news account clearly was written by a biased reporter.\\n\\nH/t my ol’ friend Sol.\\n\\n~Eowyn\\n\\nAnti-Muslim groups descend on Paris Ferry Biedermann – The National – Dec 19, 2010\\n\\nPARIS – Groups from across Europe yesterday gathered in the French capital to give voice to increasingly pronounced anti-Islam sentiments on the continent. Claiming to represent a wide range of political opinion, from Marxists and feminists to hardcore secularists and right-wing activists, the groups said they would coordinate their fight against what they call the Islamisation of Europe.\\n\\nFrench Muslim and left-wing groups denounced the gathering that drew about 500 people as divisive. The president of the mainstream French Council of the Muslim Faith, Mohammed Moussaoui, said, “We are strongly in favour of the right to free expression but we feel that such a meeting is a threat to national unity and to our ability to live together.” He accused the organisers of incitement to hatred but the authorities rejected the council’s appeal to have the meeting banned. The police cordoned off the area near the hall where the gathering took place but only a few dozen people showed up for a counter-demonstration.\\n\\nAnti-Islam groups have gained political momentum in several European countries in recent years. In Denmark and the Netherlands, political parties with a strong anti-Islam element are crucial in supporting minority governments. And in Sweden, a similar party for the first time crossed the electoral threshold in September.\\n\\nThe key personality of the Paris meeting, unmistakably, was Oskar Freysinger of the Swiss People’s Party who initiated the referendum last year in which the Swiss voted to ban the construction of minarets. The ponytailed politician, who was trailed by bodyguards in bomber jackets and black shades, was mobbed like a rock star by the crowd of mostly middle-aged and elderly Frenchmen and women. Mr Freysinger said that he was excited to take part in an effort to jointly combat the forces of Islamisation in Europe. “I do think that the Swiss model can be exported. I think that what we did can be replicated in France,” he said.\\n\\nThe meeting, organised jointly by the right-wing Bloc Identitaire and the nominally Republican left-wing Riposte Laïque, comes amid renewed tensions surrounding the presence of Muslims in France. Like elsewhere in Europe, these centre on a range of issues including demands to stop the construction of new mosques, protests against the conversion of food-outlets to halal only and an emphasis on the rights of women and gays. Less than 18 months away from the next presidential elections, several political blocs in France are taking up the matter.\\n\\nLast week, Marine Le Pen, daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen and his likely successor as leader of the ultra right-wing Front National, caused outrage by comparing the overflow of Muslims from mosques into the streets of French cities during Friday prayers with the Nazi occupation during the Second World War.\\n\\nThe Bloc identitaire is a much younger organisation, founded in 2003, but it is planning to run Arnaud Gouillon as its candidate in the 2012 presidential elections. Mr Gouillon is already well-versed in the emerging European anti-Islam discourse. “I am not against Muslims. I am against Islam,” he echoed a line also used by right-wing Dutch politician Geert Wilders and others.\\n\\nThe clash of civilisations theme was also taken up by the sole American speaker at the meeting, Tom Trenton, who founded the Florida Security Council, which bills itself as an educational organisation developed by Floridians who say they understand the extreme seriousness of the various security threats facing both the United States and Florida. Conflict with Muslim countries that promote the introduction of Sharia in the West “is inevitable” he claimed. Asked whether Islamisation is really an issue in the US, he answered, “maybe in the States we can keep things under control for a while longer but here in Europe I do not know if that’s possible”.\\n\\nWhile almost all speakers deplored the idea that they were racist or xenophobic and the organisers had been warned by the police that they would be monitored for such language, many remarks veered from alarmist into the realm of incitement. Both the Dutch and Danish speakers mentioned “gangs of Muslims” roaming the streets of Europe and alleged a link with alleged rape of women.\\n\\nMr Moussaoui of the French Council of the Muslim Faith said that the talk of Islamisation was just a cover. “The use of the term is a way of fanning fear among European populations, to make them afraid of losing their identity because of the presence of Muslims.”\\n\\nAdvertisements',\n",

And many Americans went from wage-earners to wageless completely last year. But our friends the Kochs and banksters?\\n\\nThe number of Americans making $50 million or more, the top income category in the data, fell from 131 in 2008 to 74 last year. But that’s only part of the story. The average wage in this top category increased from $91.2 million in 2008 to an astonishing $518.8 million in 2009.

Fittingly, this is a process that President Obama\\'s top economic advisor Austen Goolsbee has fought since the dark midnight of the Bush years. My understanding of economics (having taken upper-level undergraduate) is inadequate at going further. But this passes the sniff test:\\n\\nFact 1: The next employment report will be worse. When the Labor Department puts out the January employment figures on Feb. 4, they will include an assumption that a lot of companies went out of business. This is something called the birth/death model that is used by the department. Last year it caused 356,000 jobs to be subtracted from the January job count. So, the next employment figure should be shockingly bad. Fact 2: The birth/death model will then turn optimistic in the spring, causing jobs that really don\\'t exist to be added to the Labor Department\\'s count. It won\\'t make the people who are unemployed feel any better. But it could give Wall Street another excuse to rally and, really, isn\\'t that what it is all about? Fact 3: Nobody in the media will pick up on this, but the Labor De partment will also do something called a benchmark revision on Feb. 4 that will subtract around 840,000 jobs that the government thought existed, but really don\\'t. This will mostly make up for the mistakes created by the birth/death model. Fact 4: That 840,000 job adjustment will only correct errors up to March 2009. Mistakes for the April 2009 to March 2110 period will be corrected next year. Fact 5: You keep reading that the unemployment rate stayed at 10 percent. But the press has been playing up the 17.3 percent rate that includes those \"underemployed,\" meaning they can\\'t find a full-time job but want one.\\n\\nWashington:\\n\\nStop toying with monetary policy. We need fiscal spending--a point argued also by George Soros in the latest New York Review of Books. Direct hiring.

Now empower him to affect something!\\n\\nIncome inequality. Want to balance your budgets, shrink your deficits?

Lindauer says insiders know it was embezzled by agents of Israel. Interestingly, the Comptroller of the Pentagon – the man who was running the Pentagon’s finances – was a known Israeli agent, Rabbi Dov Zakheim. (Yes, he really is a rabbi!)”\\n\\nQuoting a recently-retired senior military affairs journalist at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterrey, California, Barbara Honegger, Barrett said, “The 9/11 attack on the Pentagon targeted the accountants who were on the trail of the missing trillions” and were killed in a “surgical bombing” that was carried out under the cover of “a nonexistent hijacked 757 crash at the Pentagon.”\\n\\nZakheim, according to the article, is not the only “9/11 suspect” tied to Romney’s presidential campaign. “Another is Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas mafia kingpin, who gave 100 million dollars to Romney, thereby buying Romney’s eternal enslavement to the looney-tunes Likud faction in Israel.”\\n\\nAdelson, the article added, “is reputedly linked to the same Likudnik crime mob that includes most of the key perpetrators of the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center, including ‘Lucky Larry’ Silverstein, Frank Lowy, and Lewis Eisenberg – the mobsters who stepped forward to take the money-hemorrhaging, asbestos-ridden Twin Towers off of New York City’s hands, and set up an extralegal demolition, ‘urban renewal by other means,’ to be blamed on Israel’s enemies.”\\n\\nFurthermore, the US analysts added that “the Likud crime mob that orchestrated and carried out 9/11” does not merely run the Romney campaign and the US federal courts, but are also in control of vast majority of American and global media outlets as well. “It isn’t just that the people who own and run the media tend to be Jewish and pro-Zionist, as CNN’s Rick Sanchez observed shortly before he was fired.”\\n\\n“The problem is that only six corporations control 90% of the media in America. And whether or not those six corporations are entirely owned by the Rothschilds, the founding family and true owners of Israel, they are obviously owned and controlled by the Zionists, as anyone who follows media coverage of the Middle East can see. By far the single most powerful force behind the 9/11 cover-up is the complicity of big media, which have taken every available opportunity to hide the true facts of 9/11, and trumpet the genocidal myth that Muslims were responsible.”\\n\\nsource',\n",

       " ('An article featured last week on CNN’s website by Samuel Burke highlighted the epidemic of child brides throughout the Islamic world. Burke’s article begins by discussing the marriage of Faiz, an 11-year-old girl, and Ghulam, a 40-year-old man, in Afghanistan. For most who read this article, the story was enough to turn their stomach. But then the story continues. At age 11, this little girl has already been married for seven years. That’s right, a 33 year old man married a 3 year old girl. In the article, the little girl expresses how sad she is to be married because she had once dreamed of becoming a school teacher. Now that she is married, however, she will never go to school. Her future will only consist of being a domestic and sexual slave to a 40-year-old man.\\n\\nAccording to Burke, there are approximately 51 million such child brides in the world today.\\n\\nThe report continues to show that while Muslim men are supposed to wait until their child brides reach puberty before consummating the marriage, the private testimony of many women is that few Muslim men, once married, actually wait.\\n\\nIn the report, another little girl from Yemen, named Tehani, recalls being married when she was 6 to a 25-year-old man whom she didn’t even know. Tehani is quoted as lamenting, “Whenever I saw him, I hid. I hated to see him.” Tehani didn’t even know she was getting married until the actual night of her wedding.\\n\\nAnother little girl in Yemen named Nujoud Ali, at age 10, after having already been married for two years, was actually granted a divorce. Among those few married girls who have actually heard of Nujoud’s story, she has become a symbol of freedom from their present life of enslavement. But few girls will ever find the freedom Nujoud achieved.\\n\\nGet Joel Richardson’s newest blockbuster book: “Mideast Beast: The Scriptural Case for an Islamic Antichrist”\\n\\nNow, it is important to note that in even in today’s post-modern culture so imbedded with moral and cultural relativity, very few can support this barbaric and perverse practice. Rare are those who are so morally depraved or calloused as to defend what the modern world has long recognized as perverse. One would think, therefore, that this is an issue liberals and conservatives could agree on. It should be condemned in every way imaginable.\\n\\nBeyond this, one would think that any effort to discuss child-rape-by-marriage practiced throughout portions of the Islamic world would include an acknowledgment that the widespread custom can be squarely traced back to Muhammad, the founder of Islam. It is Muhammad, after all, who is viewed by Muslims as the supreme example of moral behavior and as one who should be emulated in every way.\\n\\nThe simple fact of the matter is that Muhammad, the founder of Islam, married a little 9-year-old girl named Aisha when he was 55 years old. Don’t believe me? I am not the one making the claim. It is Islam’s own sacred sources that have long established this. Consider some of the following Islamic sacred traditions:\\n\\nAisha said: The Prophet engaged me when I was a girl of 6 (years) … my mother, came to me while I was playing on a swing with some of my girl friends. She called me, and I went to her, not knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became all right, she took some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house. There in the house I saw some Ansari women who said, “Best wishes and Allah’s Blessing and a good luck.” Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage). Unexpectedly Allah’s Apostle came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to him, and at that time I was a girl of 9 years of age. (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 58, Number 234) Hisham’s father said: Khadija died three years before Muhammad departed to Medina. He stayed there for two years or so and then he married ‘Aisha when she was a girl of 6 years of age, and he consumed that marriage when she was 9 years old. (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Volume 5, Book 58, Number 236) Aisha said that the Prophet married her when she was 6 years old and he consummated his marriage when she was 9 years old, and then she remained with him for nine years (i.e., till his death). (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Volume 7, Book 62, Number 64; see also Numbers 65 and 88) Aisha reported that Allah’s Apostle married her when she was 7 years old, and he was taken to his house as a bride when she was 9, and her dolls were with her; and when he (the Holy Prophet) died she was 18 years old. (Sahih Muslim, Book 008, Number 3311) Aisha said: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) married me when I was 7 years old. The narrator Sulaiman said: Or 6 years. He had intercourse with me when I was 9 years old. (Sunan Abu Dawud, Number 2116)\\n\\nHundreds of other traditions and Muslims scholars could be cited.\\n\\nBut here is where the liberal worldview breaks down. Here is where the hypocrisy, cowardice and double standards of the left are made evident. When given the option of condemning a dirty old man such as Jerry Sandusky, they will do so with gusto. As they should. But when Muhammad, the founder of Islam, at age 55, is known to have had sexual intercourse with an innocent little 9-year-old girl, the left will go completely silent. And when someone does bring light to this matter, they will attack him like a band of jackals.\\n\\nWhen we look back and ponder the many sins committed in the Jerry Sandusky scandal, it was not only Sandusky’s sins of abuse that were so condemnable, but also the ring of silence and cover-up that surrounded him. If the whole nation, both right and left, can rally behind the removal of a statue of Joe Paterno for his silence, why is the left so enraged when anyone mentions the truth with regard to Muhammad, who is so clearly the primary source of the child-rape-as-marriage practiced throughout many quarters of the world?\\n\\nWhen given the option of offending Muhammad’s followers or standing with the most innocent little lambs this world knows, there is no option. People of moral courage simply cannot be silent any longer.',\n",

For example, Californians for Population Stabilization have started a new ad campaign:\\n\\n“The campaign recognizes immigration as the number one factor driving U.S. population growth and makes the point that when immigrants settle in the U.S. their energy use quickly becomes Americanized. As a result, immigrants’ carbon emissions skyrocket. The result is a quadrupling of immigrants’ carbon footprint compared to the amount of carbon emissions they produced in their home countries.”\\n\\nMexicans don’t illegally immigrate to avoid starvation. The average life expectancy in Mexico is over 76 years. Instead, the major motivations for sneaking into America include: the hope of owning a big truck or SUV and to have more kids than you could afford to have in your own country. The current total fertility rate in Mexico is 2.34 babies per woman per lifetime—versus 3.7 babies among immigrant Latinas in California.\\n\\nBut, alas, the vast majority of those who claim that carbon emissions is the overwhelming issue of our age fail this test of good faith flatly.\\n\\nOn the other hand, their dishonesty doesn’t guarantee that they aren’t right about carbon and global warming. Global warming true believers seem, on the whole, like the kind of people who would be more likely to be right about something for bad reasons than for good reasons.\\n\\nAs you may have noticed from the above, I normally don’t have much to say about climate change. I’m sort of an agnostic.\\n\\nI know enough about statistics to realize how much effort would be required for me to develop an opinion worth expressing. Nor is it obvious that, even if I invested years of work, I would be able to add much value to the discussion.\\n\\nAfter all, both sides in the debate over anthropogenic global warming debate are lavishly funded. …\\n\\nYet why are those Climate Change insights so seldom applied to the question of Population Change?',\n",

       " ('An increasingly acrimonious debate with the master of a conservative website concerning neoconservative intolerance impels me to spell out my views on this subject once again. I have been told repeatedly that my reports about neoconservative offenses against me have been fabricated. If that series of misdeeds had indeed taken place, I would not be protesting. I would be taking it all on the chin with an indulgent grin. Obviously my conservative critic believes that my failure to practice forgiveness proves that my enemies do not exist. All that has been shown, however, is that as a victim of malice I am less saintly than Mother Theresa.\\n\\nTwo other censures made are that I tip my hand when I prefer the “anti-Semite” Pat Buchanan to the Commentary circle; and that I disguise my personal grievances by shifting them on to other (presumably imaginary) victims. This last point is made with reference to M.E. Bradford, the Southern literary scholar who was dropped from consideration for the NEH directorship in 1981; this happened because of Bradford’s harsh criticism of Abraham Lincoln and because of his expressed sympathy for Southern secessionists.\\n\\nThese last two charges are as bizarre as the first one. Buchanan’s attacks on the Sharon government in Israel do not prove that he is an “anti-Semite,” any more than his longtime friendship with Sharon’s onetime opponent, Yitzhak Rabin. Also one can disagree with another person, as I have with Buchanan on the Middle East and trade, without having to ascribe diabolical intentions. Unlike the Commentary circle, which practices a form of discourse that resembles that of European Communist Parties, Buchanan engages in honest debate, without sliming his opponents. That he has savaged neoconservatives is only tat for tat, considering the character assassination inflicted on him since the 1980s by what Murray Rothbard aptly called the “smearbund.” But even more importantly, unlike his enemies and mine, Buchanan has treated me consistently as a friend. Why should I dislike him more than those who have wronged me, because he is not sufficiently hawkish on Israel or trusts the Palestinians excessively? A critical difference between, on the one side, Buchanan, Ralph Raico, Lew Rockwell, and other friends with whom I have disagreed and, on the other, the neocons is that the former do not try to slit your throat as soon you dissent.\\n\\nAnd why does bringing up neoconservative slander against other people, rather than dwelling on one’s own misfortune, suggest a morbid preoccupation with one’s (allegedly fictitious) fate? What such a practice seems to indicate is just the opposite, namely an ability to look beyond one’s problem to notice a general historical pattern. That pattern is the way neocons habitually calumniate those who are perceived as being on their right or else those who are seen as unwilling to share with them government largess or posts that neocons covet. What could be discerned in my professional setbacks after the neocons had gone after Mel, and had paid their accomplices with NEH funding, partly to insert as NEH Director the mentally and physically sluggish gambler, Bill Bennett, was more of the same pattern. The successful war that Podhoretz and various Straussians waged against me in the CUA affair * was intended not only to punish someone perceived as “unreliable’ on Israel. It was also done in order that a minicon with an advanced degree would have a shot at the same post, once I had been denied. Thanks to my supporters this second success did not occur and the neocons gained at most a Pyrrhic victory.\\n\\nIt is also irritating to be told that Bradford never suffered attack from neocon quarters, except for a sage warning from the prudent Irving Kristol, that he could not be confirmed as NEH Director, because of his verbal and political immoderateness. The neocons played up Bradford’s supposed lack of moderation in numerous syndicated columns and then prepared to send visitors taken from their Heritage Foundation beneficiaries to warn then president Reagan against Bradford’s extremism. The neocons were likewise involved in all likelihood in the attacks made on Bradford by leftwing professional historians, who subsequently received NEH funding beyond the dreams of avarice, after Bennett, or, more accurately, his handlers, had taken charge. A similar campaign was launched a few years later to keep Bradford from becoming Librarian of Congress. But since the first attacks had worked so well, it was unnecessary to spend as much public money to chase Bradford away a second time. Since he died a broken man soon after, no further assaults had to be organized.\\n\\nMy critic, whose truculent Zionism may keep him from thinking clearly on this matter, should consult the second edition of my book The Conservative Movement. The work documents the extent of neoconservative malice and mischief. And it did predict in 1992 the fated success of what Claes Ryn calls “the new Jacobins’ in grabbing hold of the rudder of government and then pushing the U.S. into foreign crusades for “democracy.” My book might also suggest why neoconservative groups created to defend “academic freedom” are NEVER to be trusted. They have the same sorry kind of record of defending those who are not politically useful, e.g., paleos, as the American Communist Party had in upholding civil liberties. At my school I do not need these paladins of academic rights to protect me against anti-war protestors or critics of Ariel Sharon. By the time the second edition of my book came out in January1993, American “conservatives” were not what they claimed to be. They had become the “unthinking but animated instruments,” that Aristotle once identified as slaves, in the hands of a neoconservative master class.\\n\\nORDER IT NOW\\n\\n*In 1988 I was denied a graduate professorship at Catholic University after neoconservative celebrities, including Norman Podhoretz, called administrators nonstop for several days, on the grounds that I was “unreliable” on Israel. Because I was suspected, without evidence, of favoring negotiations between Israel and the PLO, I was deemed unfit to teach ancient Greek political texts. The campaign of vilification worked because the braindead gentile administrators were too intimidated to offer me the post that the politics department almost unanimously had voted to confer on me.\\n\\nPaul Gottfried [send him mail] is Horace Raffensperger Professor of Humanities at Elizabethtown College and author of, most recently, Multiculturalism and the Politics of Guilt.',\n",

The officers know that Tunisia has fundamentally changed. I can’t believe what the Tunisian press is saying now—nothing is off-limits—and the army hasn’t tried to stop them. The army knows that the people will never forgive them if they again imprison and torture people.” Though the old regime is far from dead in Tunisia, Tunisians are collectively crossing their fingers that the military, as an institution, is willing to take a risk on a new order where its perks are far from guaranteed.\\n\\nShould we expect the Egyptian military—the first Arab army to be “modernized” (Tunisia’s was the second)—to remain true to “the Arab street,” which has now downed the most powerful Arab dictator? The army in Egypt is massively invested in the dictatorial status quo that President Hosni Mubarak built after he assumed power from the slain Anwar Sadat in 1981. Where once the military life guaranteed at best a genteel poverty, senior Egyptian officers now live like pashas, with incomes far beyond their official salaries. Add to this pyramid of military privilege\\n\\ncivilian relatives of senior military officers who’ve used their access and protection to game Egypt’s system of crony capitalism, and mid-ranking officers who can’t conceive of themselves outside of the orbit of their uniformed patrons, and you’ve got a legion of men and women who really don’t want Egypt to change that much. The enemy of reform and democracy in Egypt—and everywhere else in the Arab world—isn’t only the power of dictators and their families but also the appetite and expectations of their armed forces, which created modern authoritarianism.\\n\\nThe democratic wave that has finally struck the Arab world is, among other things, a civilian protest movement against the militarization of Middle Eastern life. Old Oriental despotisms, for all their unpleasantness, did not fundamentally assault the civilian nature of Muslim societies, where men of the cloth, letters, the bazaar, and small-town aristocracies defined the “good and noble.” The Egyptian Gamal Abdel Nasser, the icon of modern, demagogic militarism, swept away the old world and promised a nationalist and Arabist renaissance. Spiritually crushed by the 1967 Israeli victory, and economically impoverished by socialism, this new-age authoritarianism halfheartedly discovered capitalism in the 1980s. Robbed of ideology and military purpose (defeating Israel became a millenarian dream, like the ancient Arab aspiration to conquer Constantinople), Arab armies became instruments of political oppression and private enrichment.\\n\\nThey did, however, remain conscript armies. Unlike the despotisms of old, which were dependent on small, professional armies of slave soldiers (in Egypt, they were called “mameluks”), modern autocracy has depended on the common man. Nationalism, the most successful Western export to the Muslim world, is sacred for most Egyptians—even for the Muslim Brotherhood, whose universalist Islamic aspirations have been in a tug-of-war with Egyptian nationalism for 80 years. And this patriotic common man has increasingly embraced democracy as the only legitimate organizing political ideal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow much has the seductive idea of democracy percolated from the bottom up, and from the top down via intellectuals, into the officer ranks of the Egyptian Army? Do the senior officers really believe in a “soft landing” in a democratic Egypt? A democratic Egypt, cursed with bloated bureaucracies and a still vibrant socialist ethic, would likely cut back military expenditures severely in an effort to maintain public-sector civilian jobs. More or less, the Egyptian Army has been able to wall off its defense budget—and senior officers’ posh lifestyles—from economic reality. America’s yearly billion-dollar military-aid package has allowed the Egyptian Army to enjoy toys— advanced Abrams tanks, F-16 aircraft, and Israeli-ship-killing surface-to-surface missiles—that would be unthinkable if purchased only through Egyptian taxes. It’s a decent guess that a democratic Egypt will distance itself from America’s military largesse—seeing it, not incorrectly, as an enabler of autocracy. A democratic Egypt will demand a more humble, less well-fed military establishment. Do Egyptian military officers believe that angry liberals and even angrier Muslim Brothers won’t eventually expropriate all that their families have accumulated under martial rule?\\n\\nThe denouement of Mubarak’s reign may give hope to the military for a soft landing. The lack of violence in the demonstrations throughout the country—despite the bloody provocations of Egyptian security forces—has been astonishing. It would be unwise to underestimate the vengeful sentiments that are undoubtedly widespread or to overestimate the moderating effect of Egypt’s age-old settled culture, which has little of the open nastiness so common in Algeria or Iraq. But the restraint of the demonstrators has been—for the Egyptians themselves—ennobling. This pacifism has certainly deterred the army from brutality; it may well push the military towards backing more representative government over the coming months.\\n\\nWe should, however, assume that the military’s recidivist impulse is strong. We should also assume that the Egyptian Army doesn’t yet view the events of January and February as the prelude to a real revolution, but only as an uprising that required Mubarak to depart in order to preserve “the system.”\\n\\nPresident Obama appears to be abandoning the pro-authoritarian, status-quo realism that had defined his administration’s policy toward the Middle East. The June 12, 2009, electoral earthquake in Tehran barely shook the White House (the diplomatic effort to stop the mullahs’ quest for nuclear weapons trumped whatever pro-democracy empathy President Obama may have felt for the Iranian demonstrators). But Tahrir Square may have finally broken the hold that Washington’s authoritarian-tolerant liberal foreign-policy establishment (think the pro-Mubarak emissary Frank Wisner) had on the president. Bill Burns, Middle Eastern dictators’ favorite diplomat at the State Department, may still be number three at Foggy Bottom, but it’s a good guess that he will no longer be making quips about how U.S. foreign policy aims to turn “Putin into our [Russian] Mubarak.” (The idea actually now has a certain appeal.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContrary to so much chic leftist chatter, the United States still has an important role to play in Egypt’s democratic transition. We still possess considerable financial leverage on Egypt’s military; we should not hesitate to use it if the army doesn’t immediately end the draconian police-state emergency regulations and soon establish a transitional government whose membership includes prominent nonmilitary men. A transitional government should be open to all—including members of the Muslim Brotherhood—and must have real authority. That government, not the military, should set the calendar for new elections and decide whether Egypt’s current constitution can be revised or is better chucked into the trash bin. (Probably the latter.)\\n\\nAs President Obama may know now, the most difficult time for his administration lies in the months ahead, when the Egyptian Army will test to see how much autocracy (and wealth) it can keep in its hands. There will surely be an enormous temptation in Washington, on both the left and right, to side with the army for a “slow” transition or even a “restrictive democracy,” where the Muslim Brothers are excluded from parliament. Much of Washington, like most in the European Union, wants to support democracy in Egypt, but a democracy that follows the exact same policies as Mubarak’s dictatorship.\\n\\nSuch a democracy is unlikely to be born. Egyptians need the liberty to grow as they see fit and as they can. Real liberal democracy in the Arab world lies down this difficult path. There is reason to hope that President Obama, whose sympathies in the past inclined him toward “authentic” third-world potentates, may understand now that George W. Bush was right to castigate the foreign policy that Bush senior adored. In any case, President Obama and Egypt are now tied together. If Egyptian democracy gets off the ground, the odds are decent that the president will be able to reinvent himself overseas. That may not be enough to save him in 2012 from his domestic policies. But it might.\\n\\nReuel Marc Gerecht is a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a contributing editor to The Weekly Standard, and the author of The Wave: Man, God, and the Ballot Box in the Middle East (Hoover Institution Press).',\n",

       " ('An up-to-date unretouched snapshot of India...\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia, a BRICS country, is actually nowhere to be seen while Brazil, South Africa, Russia and China are increasingly facing hostile attacks. India is not helping, as the United States and Europe are now manufacturing all sorts of ‘opposition movements’ inside countries that are still in the West’s path to total and unopposed global dominance. India, a BRICS country, is silent as both China and Russia are being encircled, provoked and stabbed; at a time when their neighboring countries are constantly being pitched against them, ideologically and militarily. India, a BRICS country, does not seem to mind as the US increases its military presence in Asia, from Okinawa to the Philippines and Qatar, or when Russia is being demonized and provoked by insane propaganda and by lunatic sanctions, imposed by the West which is actually the one that overthrew the Ukrainian government, putting in place a brutal fascist dictatorship.\\n\\nAnd as the Western mass media outlets are now in top gear, spreading propaganda all over the world; the Indian newspapers, magazines and television stations, are dutifully reprinting and repeating the many vitriolic lies and fabrications, in exactly the same way as the Philippine and Indonesian business-owned media outlets are doing. But the Philippines and Indonesia are the West’s client states, and they do not belong to BRICS, while India does, at least on paper.\\n\\nIn the Economic & Political Weekly, published in 2013, Atul Bhardwaj wrote:\\n\\n“India has got itself trapped into an anti-Chinese matrix set in place by the United States. This has led to a situation where the military is increasing its say in foreign and domestic policy and pushing aggressive postures on to the civilian government. Unless India abandons its aspirations to great power status and pursues a foreign policy which builds on Asian cooperation and strengths, it will continue to become cannon fodder for western strategic aims.”\\n\\nThat’s correct, but it is not only the anti-Chinese matrix; it is the staunchly pro-Western matrix that is serving India’s ruling elites, and it is the matrix of disinformation and ignorance imposed on the members of the underprivileged majority.\\n\\nI went back to India to see where the country really stands in relation to BRICS. I opted for a very much unplanned, chaotic, jazzy and spontaneous journey. I wanted to speak to those of the Indian majority; to people in the villages and towns, to ask them what they really know about BRICS, about the new winds of freedom and progress that are blowing all over Latin America, about tremendous social changes in China, and about their own lives in the country, which the West continually defines as ‘the largest democracy on earth’.\\n\\n*\\n\\nTwo village women are covered from head to toe in colorful fabric, and unlike in Saudi Arabia where only the eyes are visible, but totally. They are carrying huge crooked tin plates on their heads, and those plates are full of cow dung.\\n\\nThe village is called Karora, it is located almost 200 kilometers north from New Delhi, in Haryana State.\\n\\nIt is here that, in 2007, a newlywed couple was murdered in cold blood, after the assembly of village elders, Panchayat, passed ‘the verdict’. Both the girl (18) and boy (23) were only ‘guilty’ of belonging to the same sub-clan.\\n\\nThe Deccan Herald reported then:\\n\\n“In June 2007, the couple was dragged out of a Karnal-bound bus by the girl’s relatives and was brutally murdered. Their bodies were paraded in the village and then dumped in a canal.”\\n\\nWe did not come here to only discuss honor killing and the horrible lot of Indian women; we came here to this remote corner of Haryana to discuss what the West calls ‘the biggest democracy on earth’, and above all, how India really fits into the BRICS, and to their determined fight against Western imperialism and market fundamentalism.\\n\\nYes, India is part of BRICS; but it is feudal in the countryside and capitalist in the cities. It is increasingly close to its colonial master and to the grand Empire.\\n\\nWe could not see the expression on the faces of the two Karora village women when we asked them about democracy, voting, women’s rights, caste oppression and honor killing. But the first female began speaking, bravely if reluctantly, in front of an entire army of onlookers:\\n\\n“I’m only a poor village woman, how can I know such things? I have to work for 14 hours every day to make out a living for my family. My husband doesn’t have any regular work, and he is an alcoholic. I’m constantly worried about my children going hungry. The government doesn’t care about people like us and I don’t know who else could help. I’m very afraid so I can’t talk more about the caste system or honor killings. Women have no freedom here. “\\n\\nThe second lady echoes her, and then adds:\\n\\n“I know the family of the eloped couple who suffered at the hands of Panchayat but I can’t talk about it. I’m afraid of such things. Women have no freedom here. Most of us are struggling to survive and I don’t know how things could be better, anytime soon. About democracy: I don’t know how the election could improve living conditions in this village and I don’t know about people’s movement in other countries or about things that are happening elsewhere.”\\n\\nSoon, the crowd of onlookers begins to participate in the discussion.\\n\\nThe youths surrounded us to find out the reason for our sudden appearance in their village.\\n\\nA boy named Biswan, wearing a black T-shirt, explained:\\n\\n“My impression of what they call ‘Indian democracy’ and of the political parties that are participating in this game is… that it is a pattern of appealing for votes by some political party, with the inducement of local liquor by their men to the villagers, one day before every election day, then disappearing, to be never seen again for the next 5 years. We don’t have work here nor can anyone make a decent living with earnings here. I don’t feel this type of democracy works for us… We still haven’t got real freedom.”\\n\\nThen the village youths begin speaking over each other:\\n\\n“Money talks here, we are all educated to some degree, but only those who can afford to bribe some officials manage to get regular employment. We are poor villagers and unaware of developments in our own country, then how can we know about China, Latin America or other countries?”\\n\\nThe forlorn expression on the faces of the villagers showed their frustration, even resignation. Most certainly, we saw no hope and no enthusiasm here.\\n\\nIndia is feudal in the countryside and capitalist in the cities.\\n\\nOur driver, Sunil, appeared to be extremely unhappy to be here. “In these villages, they have already torched so many cars belonging to those who came to ask questions!”\\n\\nI insist that we have to finish our work here, in the heart of Haryana State. The driver fumes. He drives us around, missing the motorway a few times, but after we activate our navigation system, he gives up and just gets us where we want to go.\\n\\nLater, in Delhi, my good friend and colleague, Anish, calls me and explains:\\n\\n“Before he dropped me home, he said that he was so mad at you, he was ready to drive into a tree and kill us all.\\n\\n“Kill us?” I thought I misunderstood.\\n\\n“Yes. You may want to know that he was a soldier, serving in Kashmir… He told me that much, just a few minutes ago. We had a chat… He said he was court-martialed, because he killed a few civilians there. In Kashmir, in 1996, he was on a mission to capture members of some insurgency group, but things went wrong and the people he was after, had fled… So he opened fire on civilians, killing several of them. He said he used a LMG inside the house, emptying 2 magazines of ammunition, killing at least 3 civilians… Just like that!”\\n\\n“Why is he driving a taxi?” I asked. “Isn’t he supposed to be in prison?”\\n\\nAnish just commented, laconically:\\n\\n“When we discussed this, he was depressed. Not because of what he had done, but because he was caught and punished. He said to me: ‘was I to have managed to kill at least one insurgent, then even if I killed dozens of civilians, I would never have got court-martialed.”\\n\\nI wondered whether this approach is one that would really serve as an inspiration for the BRICS countries.\\n\\n*\\n\\nSome 1,500 kilometers from Karora Village, in Mumbai, a monster building belonging to the richest man in India, Mukesh Ambani, is allegedly the most expensive dwelling ever constructed on this planet.\\n\\nArundhati Roy describes Ambani’s home in her book “Capitalism A Ghost Story”:\\n\\n“…The twenty seven floors, three helipads, nine lifts, hanging gardens, ballrooms, weather rooms, gymnasiums, six floors of parking, and six hundred servants… In a nation of 1.2 billion, India’s one hundred richest people own assets equivalent to one-fourth of the GDP.”\\n\\nBut to own all those billions is not enough. In order to rule, in order to fully control society, this small group of modern day rajas has to always find a way to morally justify their medieval, feudalist behavior.\\n\\nThe most effective way to do it is through almost total control of the media. Arundhati Roy continues:\\n\\n“Mukesh Ambani is personally worth $20 billion. He holds a majority-controlling share in Reliance Industries Limited (RIL)… RIL recently bought 95 shares in Infotel, a TV consortium that controls twenty-seven TV news and entertainment channels, including CNN-IBN, IBN Live, CNBC, IBN Lokmat, and ETV in almost every regional language. Infotel owns the only nation-wide license for 4G broadband, a high-speed information pipeline which, if the technology works, could be the future of information exchange.”\\n\\nThe criticism of Indian elites does not only come from the Left. The Conservative British news magazine, The Economist, recently ran its cover story about Ambani: “An Unloved Billionaire”, making the rhetorical suggestion, “Why Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest man, needs to reform his empire”:\\n\\n“Reliance’s relationship with the government is even more troubling. Anti-corruption campaigners claim Mr Ambani is the power behind the throne of India’s political leaders…”\\n\\nIn Indian ‘democracy’, the real rulers of the country pay politicians, to get to the top, while the voters get paid to vote a certain way, which is suitable to the regime. Mass media shapes public opinion constantly, so it stays exactly where the elites want it to stay.\\n\\nFrom an amazing tolerance level for medieval oppressive ‘cultural practices’, to the gross cruelty towards women and ethnic/religious minorities, India is hardly a beacon of light for other BRICS nations, or, for the rest of the world. The way its economy, election practices, foreign policy and government systems are structured, the Indian state is much closer to MINT (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, Turkey – although in this group, too, there is Mexico, which is, despite everything, culturally and historically, in the Social Democratic camp), a group which, if allowed to join BRICS, would surely destroy their political and social direction: (http://www.counterpunch.org/...).\\n\\nBut the West is always extremely generous towards its allies and economic cohorts. It promotes and glorifies those countries that are willing to sacrifice their people, throwing them on the sacrificial altar of global market fundamentalism.\\n\\nTherefore, for the West, both Indonesia and India, two enormous and impoverished countries, are the true democratic and economic stars!\\n\\n*\\n\\nDLF Promenade in Vasant Kunj is a symbol of new wealth, hosting some of the top international retail brands, from Armani to Prada.\\n\\nThere are literally armies of guards, some in their white butler informs, others armed with guns. Photographing is prohibited. Surveillance is constant, just as in every place frequented by the elites.\\n\\nSituated right near the DLF Promenade is the Khushampur Pahari slum, a place that is miserable and rough. Children move around aimlessly and barefoot. It is not as dirty as many of the much bigger settlements in Mumbai or Calcutta are, but still, people here are clearly desperate and deprived.\\n\\nMr. Jagdish is a ‘wage laborer’, not permanently employed:\\n\\n“I have no regular work and the system is geared for the rich. We, poor people who form the great majority in India, don’t count.”\\n\\nI ask him about the mall, but he insists on calling it ‘that huge building’:\\n\\n“There is that huge building, but I don’t go there. They built it nearby, but I would never be allowed to enter. I would be beaten up if I try to go there.”\\n\\nHe looks into the distance:\\n\\n“We are struggling here to meet basic needs. We don’t have clean drinking water and before each election they offer us free electricity supply and water. Promises that are never fulfilled; they lie to us. And they have always lied, whether it is the Congress Party or BJP…”\\n\\nNear and yet very far from affluence...\\n\\nBelow: The Khushampur Pahari slum.\\n\\n\\n\\nElectric poles and wires hang loosely above the roofs of the settlement. I ask whether people here are managing to get free electricity supply, by simply stealing the juice as they do in Peru or in Haiti, but the answer is resolutely ‘no’. They check on them, constantly. In fact, people here suffer from gross overcharging by the private company, Reliance Energy (owned by Anil Ambani, brother of the richest man in the country, the abovementioned Mukesh Ambani), which supplies power to this entire area.\\n\\n“We are receiving a 1,000 Rs (approximately US$16) bill, every month”, explains an old couple next door. “On top of it we have to bribe employees of the electric company, to keep the connection. We have to go begging to more fortunate neighborhoods for water, and it is not always that the people there are willing to help us.”\\n\\nAn old man in the house actually follows what is happening in the world:\\n\\n“I am aware of changes that are taking place in China, but our government is not doing the same things for us. Here, things are so bad that if we fall seriously ill, we simply die.”\\n\\n“What about democracy?” I ask.\\n\\n“Democracy is for the rich.”\\n\\nMr. Jagdish chips in: “As you heard, political parties come here, and they promise us free electricity and water, but nothing happens after the elections. Democracy is not working for us; it is the tool for the people with money to keep in power.”\\n\\nDown an alley, a lady with a child confirms that there is no supply of clean water to this settlement.\\n\\nEventually, small barefoot children begin begging.\\n\\n*\\n\\nThe ITC Hotel manager in Jaipur, Rajasthan, philosophizes:\\n\\n“Arvind Kejriwal from AAM Admi Party (AAP) was very critical of the private media, and the mass media got extremely angry with him… You see; Arvind Kejriwal could become the Indian answer to the Latin American leadership!”\\n\\nSo I go to see him and his people.\\n\\nOn 3 August 2014, at the ancient star observatory, Jantar Mantar, in New Delhi, Aam Aadmi party held a mass gathering consisting of around 5,000 local residents, who were demanding fresh elections. There were fiery speeches coming from the podium and the AAP’s leader, Arwind Kerjiwal, agitated the dense crowd with anti-corruption slogans, swearing he would implement reforms, were he to be voted in, back into the office. He was also promising to improve the lot of the common man. The reigning cry of the day was of getting rid of the oppressor ruling class through the democratic contest of the ballot boxes. (Something attempted in good faith by Chile\\'s Socialist president Salvador Allende with tragic results.—Eds)\\n\\nHere, surely, people knew something about BRICS and the Latin American revolutions?\\n\\nBut it was not the case. The campaign was almost exclusively about corruption.\\n\\nMr. Pawan Das, a cable manufacturer from the Shahdara constituency, spoke about the impact of AAP and the ex-chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, and his former 49 days rule in Delhi:\\n\\n“I noticed the policeman in our factory who used to extort Rs.300 bribe money from me every month, didn’t turn up for 3 months. I egged him on to collect his extortion dues on coming across him, and enquired as to why he didn’t come to get the money, to which he replied, evasively, that he was posted on an election duty. I retorted: ‘were you really engaged in any election duty or got scared by the fear of prosecution instituted by Arvind Kejriwal’s strong anti-corruption measures?’\\n\\nBut BRICS or the fight against Western imperialism – definitely not!\\n\\n“On asking about their stance on India’s strengthening alliance with the American government and India’s unassuming posture at BRICS meeting, all of them expressed their unawareness about such matters”, explained Anish, in rather decorative language.\\n\\nThen, at Jantar Mantar, we encountered several individuals who clearly demonstrated the art of sitting on two chairs.\\n\\nBoth Mr. Deepak Lal and his wife voiced their favorable opinion about the strengthening of ties with America:\\n\\n“It’s in the interest of India to be a great partner in creating alternatives to the dominant paradigm offered by the U.S., but at the same time India-US relations should remain unaffected”.\\n\\nAnother old couple went on in an even more Kafkaesque manner:\\n\\n“US-India relation is the way to the rise of India along with creating alignments leading to a multipolar world”.\\n\\n*\\n\\nAt the May Day Bookstore in New Delhi, after an avant-garde theatre performance, I met my friend Sudhanva. Comrade Sudhanva Deshpande, is the editor of LeftWord Books, as well as a famous Indian intellectual and actor. He explained:\\n\\n“You are absolutely right posing the question: “Where is India in all this? It is very a good question because it is well known that for the last several years, a decade or more, Indian foreign policy had turned more and more towards the US. A few years ago, India conducted the Indo-US nuclear deal. That led to a lot of opposition back home, here in India, but the government went ahead with the deal. The Hindu right became more and more oriented towards the US. The government also argued for much closer ties with Israel. As you know, India is the biggest buyer of Israeli arms in the world today.”\\n\\n“Earlier this year, in May, in the general elections, the party of the Hindu right, which is Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), came to power. It is led by Narendra Modi, the man who is widely seen as being complicit in the pogrom of Muslims, in his homestay, Gujarat, in 2002, when he was a chief minister. His campaign was a very muscular campaign, a very macho campaign… He presented himself and his party as aggressively nationalist. The pre-election campaign was marked by anti-Muslim violence and rhetoric. As for foreign policy, there had been a long-term trend for more and more orientation towards the West, towards the US. In the current aggression on Gaza, for instance, the Indian government took the stand of so-called ‘equidistance’ from both Israel and Hamas, and this is really… this is compromising India’s long-term commitment to the cause of Palestinian independence. And this goes back to even the 1940’s, when India was not even independent.\\n\\nThe fact that India itself was a colony, and that it fought an anti-colonial struggle – it all seems now as a distant memory.”\\n\\nI asked Sudhanva about BRICS, concretely: “Is it even possible that India, where it stands right now, could and should be considered as a member of BRICS?”\\n\\n“I think right now, Indian foreign policy is trying to calibrate its position”, he replies”.\\n\\nAnd he continued:\\n\\n“On one hand there is a trend towards more and more alignment with the US, and on closer and closer ties with Israel. So that’s on the one side. On the other side there are also hard economic realities. And that is what forced the Indian establishment to look towards formations like the BRICS. If indeed it so happens that BRICS will not be just an economic club, but if it starts taking a more determined anti-imperialist position, then the Indian establishment would have to really decide, where it stands. I don’t see India taking an anti-imperialist stand anytime soon, beyond some lip service.”\\n\\nWe talk about the past, about India’s determined anti-imperialist stand in its post-colonial period. Nehru brought this country to Bandung, Indonesia, in 1955, where the Non-Aligned movement was created.\\n\\nSudhanva explains:\\n\\n“India abandoned the Non-Alignment movement, effectively, in the late 80’s. In some sense you can say that it happened in Delhi, in the early 80’s, that it was the swansong of the non-alignment movement… The fact was that India became more and more ambivalent towards the idea of non-alignment, which helped to terminate the movement, because India was such an important part of it.”\\n\\nAnd then India took a neo-liberal turn, in the early 90’s, and even the past was forgotten.\\n\\n*\\n\\nWhat can be expected of the present nationalist government of Narendra Modi, in relation to BRICS?\\n\\nBenny Kuruvilla is from Kerala, a recognized expert on BRICS, and political lead at the ‘South Solidarity Initiative’. I met him, and his Chilean wife, Susana Barria, a labor organizer, after a demonstration in support of Palestine, in front of the Kerala House, in the center of New Delhi.\\n\\nBenny readily clarified:\\n\\n“Modi and his government would be happy to be part of the Western alliance and of the BRICS… This is really an ultra-nationalist government, and it has to reassert its ideology… In the past it was all very different: during the Cold War, India was very close to Cuba, and to the USSR. Now that India has a very pronounced right-wing government, it is very reluctant to side with the anti-Western block. I don’t think India will go along with the idea that the Western concept should be cancelled. Indian Left-wing forces are very weak now, and this government is so happy to be part of big-boy’s club; for them it is the place in the sun! What is happening in BRICS and in Latin America is mainly monitored by the local intelligentsia; mainly by the upper class.”\\n\\nSusana appeared to be more optimistic and hopeful, believing in change, and in a way she echoed what Noam Chomsky told me about the Arab world, several years ago:\\n\\n“Look, some 5 years before Hugo Chavez came to power in Venezuela, everything was bleak, in many parts of Latin America. We did not think that everything would be reversed so fast. We should not underestimate that things could change very fast.”\\n\\nBut India is not Venezuela. All three of us agreed that the Indian Left is too ‘purist’. It is stuck in theoretical definitions of what Communism or Socialism should be. For its taste, China is not socialist enough; most of the Latin American countries are not really strictly Marxist. In the end, much is being discussed here, but very little achieved.\\n\\nThe next day I asked my friend Anish Gopinathan, a former international banker who spent several years working in Dubai, before returning, disgusted, back to India and began studying the Chinese language, and culture, whether all that I asked and heard so far made any sense. He replied:\\n\\n“Yes. In 2002 MP Modi was the Chief Minister in Gujarat, during the pogrom. For years, there was a US ban on him, a refusal to issue him an entry visa. That ban was lifted around the time of elections…”\\n\\nThe same happened in Indonesia, against Prabowo, an ultra-nationalist who was accused of crimes against humanity in Indonesia and blacklisted by the US Department of the State, but was quickly rehabilitated when he almost won the presidential elections earlier this year.\\n\\nAnish concluded:\\n\\n“Modi is pro-business and pro-West. But in a way, he can also sometimes stand against the West, and for India. You often mentioned the Indian colonial hangover, when Indian elites shamefully idealize the colonial era. Well, Modi is one politician who does not have this hangover… For instance, he insists on using Hindi at international meetings. All our elites were conditioned in the West: Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Manmohan Singh… But not Modi! In fact he represents a big break against that colonial hangover… But the price is – he wants his Hindu state!”\\n\\n*\\n\\nHindu state… We flew to Varanasi, to the ‘holy city’ built on the banks of Ganga River. It is a depressing, oppressed and miserably poor city, but at the same time it is the place that the current MP – Mr. Modi – was elected from.\\n\\nWe went to Kashi Vishwanath Temple, to talk to Brahmin priests, about their vision for India.\\n\\nThe results were shocking.\\n\\nMr. Pandey spoke to us in front of two military sentinels guarding the entrance to the temple. He was a Brahmin priest, associated with this place of worship since his childhood:\\n\\n“I am here, I am a priest, because… actually… I couldn’t get a job anywhere else. Really, no regular employment for me… And so, this is how I make a living… To me, religion is important, because it gives me some income… I like Americans, because they come here, and give us money… Somehow I sense that they feel good, giving us money… I have no idea about the developments in China, Russia or Latin America… I really don’t care.”\\n\\nMr. Shyama Prasad Sharma who also works for the temple, clarified his views:\\n\\n“Latin America? BRICS? No, we don’t have time for stuff like that. We are busy here, at this temple, with business, with trade.”\\n\\nWhat about something higher, more enlightened than that?\\n\\nHe walks away.\\n\\nAnish is outraged:\\n\\n“This is like some market place; market mentality. It is like some fish market or vegetable market, or stock market! No time for any big questions in life! This is what BJP is fighting for. Hindu state… It is exactly what the mullahs in Pakistan are trying to create in their madrasahs. A cold, religious society; the code of primitive society…”\\n\\nDesperate, we approach a simple man, a vegetarian food vendor. His name is Mr. Anoop Upadhyaya and he somehow brings things into perspective:\\n\\n“I voted for Modi because my parents ordered me to do it. I don’t expect much improvement from his government. If they deliver even some 25% of what they were promising us, I would be satisfied. We are always ‘Bhajpa’ (BJP)… That is what we are. We don’t think about it, don’t question it.”\\n\\nWe ask about BRICS.\\n\\nHe does not react, as if we were talking about some distant planet.\\n\\n*\\n\\nAt some point I had had enough and I expressed a desire to visit some old-fashioned school to talk to teachers who were already there, teaching, before India entered the pragmatically-oblivious realm.\\n\\nI was taken to Bhigan, just across the border from the capital, on the very edge of Haryana State, to a well-organized, clean and optimistic looking primary school.\\n\\nI don’t know if what I saw was true or whether my friends were just being too kind to me, creating a spectacle, similar to that in the film ‘Goodbye Lenin’.\\n\\nThe educators and the principal – Mr. Kuldeep Singh Chavhan, as well as the history and physical education teacher – were extremely kind, knowledgeable and supportive.\\n\\nWe all expressed our admiration for the Soviet Union, and then we condemned Western imperialism.\\n\\n“Friendship with Russia!” screamed one of the teachers.\\n\\n“Israel is the oppressor! US are behind Israel!”\\n\\nThen the Principal spoke:\\n\\n“We are very well aware that the US is trying to buy India through its multi-national companies!’\\n\\nThen I spoke.\\n\\nIt all felt like a scene from a long time ago, even before I was born…\\n\\nWe did not hug, kiss or embrace. We did not sing. But it all felt fantastic.\\n\\nA dog barked outside.\\n\\nChildren began leaving the school. We were still speaking.\\n\\nThen I asked about BRICS.\\n\\n“There is an issue,” the Principal admitted. “I am not really aware of the BRICS’s cooperation with India.”\\n\\n“But…” I howled: “India is member of BRICS.”\\n\\nSilence.\\n\\n“But Modi went to Brazil!”\\n\\n“I don’t know”, said the Principal, sadly.\\n\\n‘It’s better if we sing!’ I thought.\\n\\n*\\n\\nFrom the other geographical extreme of the country, in the poorest Dalit villages around Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu, my dear friend Venkat (he wanted to use only his first name for this report), a Cambridge-educated Brahmin, who was so appalled by the helplessness of the poor people, that he went against all that the upper cast and the elites represent, wrote to me:\\n\\n“The Indian social and political landscape hasn’t changed in years. Like the distant mirage, new governments come and go giving hope to the parched souls who are soon left out to die with still hope in their eyes!\\n\\nThe new middle class, thanks to the growth of IT, has often been praised and written about but this is only a small percentage although in a country of this size even such small percentages works out to be huge in numbers! (The pride of the \"New India\" comprises no more than 5% of the population, a 60-million segment of relative privilege that is in effect a nation within a nation.—Eds)\\n\\nAn average rural person is still struggling to make ends meet and still hoping for the “paradise’ that every politician promises! There is no time to read, think, discuss about other issues that affect the nation or the world. Cricket stars, film stars and sleazy politics conveniently fascinate Indian media, as the mass media are only concerned about TRP ratings and not about what people think and want!\\n\\nSo, discussions about BRICS or what happens in Syria or Iraq doesn’t really matter. Many villagers accept the stereotypes that the western media has painted. For example – the US is the land of wealth; China means cheap goods, Latin America – Che on your T-shirts and Cigars, Africa- famine and dangerous diseases, Middle East- only war!\\n\\nThe education system is being so commercialized that Indian youth are actually produced in large numbers, lacking even the skills that Industry wants!\\n\\nUnless ‘real’ education is given to our children, we may not have a ‘thinking’ population in the future. But only if people are educated, can we hope for a greater critical mass of intellectuals who can guide the country.”\\n\\n*\\n\\nAfter having our boarding passes scanned at the gate and before entering the airplane, passengers had to go through three more military checkpoints. The entire state of affairs appeared to be thoroughly Kafkaesque. This confused, frustrated ‘police state’ was using its military, cops and other armed forces to intimidate and to keep at bay its own citizens. It has been doing it, for decades, in the most open and despicable way.\\n\\nI still remember how in Gujarat, after that horrid sectarian pogrom of 2002, the Akshardham Temple killing and both (then) Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and Sonia Gandhi, decided to visit the area. A huge crowd gathered, to welcome the politicians. It was a very peaceful crowd, consisting mainly of poor onlookers. But the police began beating the people with batons, savagely, just ‘preventively’ I was told, as if it were the most natural thing on earth: ‘The largest democracy on earth at work’. Nobody dared to protest against such treatment.\\n\\nAfter talking to many, it appears that the poor see it all very clearly now: in the villages and in the slums, they laugh and cry or gesticulate angrily whenever the word ‘democracy’ is uttered in front of them. Most of the poor (that is the great majority of the country) have no doubts that they are living in a country whose rulers and oligarchs, backed by the security apparatus, are alimenting on their sweat, misery and blood.\\n\\nThose ‘educated classes’, including most of the intellectuals from the Indian ‘Left’, live in a continuous and great deception. Most of them are desperately clinging to the notion that has been spread by the old and new Western colonial masters: that India is actually the largest democracy on earth.\\n\\nEven those individuals in India who see clearly that both European and North American ‘democracies’ are increasingly becoming nothing else other than a grand farce, do not dare to admit that their own, Indian, multi-party system (aped from the West) in which all major political parties are controlled by corporate interests, as most of the mass media is, have been totally failing to represent the interests of the Indian majority.\\n\\n‘Democracy’ is not a secretive and complicated scientific formula. It only means, in Greek, ‘the rule of the people’. And it goes without saying that most of the long-suffering Indian people that I spoke to, do not feel that they are ruling their own country!\\n\\n*\\n\\nJust before I took off from Delhi, I found myself sitting right next to a member of the new local elites. A Sikh man, who began with the usual line of interrogation: where am I from, where do I live, what is my line of work? Dutifully and calmly, I replied. Then he offered his short biography: he was a manufacturer and owned 3 homes in 3 different parts of the world: one in India, one in Bangkok and one in Vancouver. “I am taking my family back to Bangkok, now”, he explained. “I have a wonderful house there. It is such a great place to live.”\\n\\n“It is quite complicated there, lately”, I suggested, neutrally. “After the coup…”\\n\\nMy statement shocked him: “Why do you say that? It is all very simple. One and a half months ago it was complicated, but after the army took over, everything is great.”\\n\\n“For you, maybe”, I said, “And for the Thai elites, as well as for their Western handlers.”\\n\\nHe gave me that look, indicating that I was actually nothing more than a piece of dirt to him; that very look, which has increasingly began appearing on the faces of the new Indian ‘elites’, in those 5 star malls and hotels, in both India itself, and in countries like Thailand and Malaysia, which are now inundated by corrupt Indian officials and businessmen.\\n\\nThe conversation ended: from then on, arrogantly, he refused to reply to anything that I uttered, ignoring my attempts to be at least essentially civil and polite to someone who was occupying the seat next to me.\\n\\nI did not ask about BRICS. I knew what he would reply: “They should all go to hell!” or something of that nature.\\n\\n*\\n\\nBRICS countries have to maintain high standards, if they are to make a significant difference in this world. Their determination to fight against colonialism, imperialism and for true freedom for countries worldwide cannot and should not be diluted.\\n\\nIf states like Indonesia, with governments full of war criminals and mass murderers, and one of the most inhumane economic/social systems on earth, are allowed to join, if Turkey, a member of NATO and one of the closest allies of the West in the Middle East, with several Western air force and military bases, is allowed to join; if India, which is openly and shamelessly collaborating with the West while sitting on two chairs is allowed to maintain its membership, then BRICS will soon lose all of its clout as well as its moral upper-hand.\\n\\nIf such a scenario takes place, the world will lose an alternative, and that would be an enormous tragedy.\\n\\nIndia matters. Its people matter! It is a great and important nation. It used to be ‘our nation’. It used to stand firmly against colonialism and imperialism. In many ways, and in many of its parts, it still does.\\n\\nIndia should wake up. It is needed. It should rebel against the oppressive system, both domestic and global. And it should become a proud BRICS nation: with all its heart, and not just on paper!\\n\\n_____________\\n\\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\\n\\n\\n\\nAndre Vltchek is a novelist, filmmaker and investigative journalist.

And then they attacked the Church, and he was a Churchman, and he did something - but then it was too late.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" I said.\\n\\n\"You see,\" my colleague went on, \"one doesn\\'t see exactly where or how to move. Believe me, this is true. Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for the one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don\\'t want to act, or even to talk, alone; you don\\'t want to \\'go out of your way to make trouble.\\' Why not? - Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty...\\n\\n\"Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, everyone is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You know, in France or Italy there will be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences; in Germany, outside the great cities, perhaps, there is not even this. In the university community, in your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, \\'It\\'s not so bad\\' or \\'You\\'re seeing things\\' or \\'You\\'re an alarmist.\\'\\n\\n\"And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can\\'t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don\\'t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. ...\\n\\n\"But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That\\'s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and the smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked - if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in \\'43 had come immediately after the \\'German Firm\\' stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in \\'33. But of course this isn\\'t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.\\n\\n\"And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying \\'Jew swine,\\' collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in - your nation, your people - is not the world you were in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God.\" ...\\n\\nNow that\\'s a lot to digest. But doesn\\'t that passage strike a chord with you? Doesn\\'t that sound an awful lot like what\\'s been going on in THIS country, NOW and today and for the past six years?\\n\\nDoesn\\'t this passage put the Patriot Act (a charming euphamism for totalitarianism), the Secret Prisons, the Extraordinary Renditions, the emasculation of Habeas Corpus, the NSA wiretapping, the warrantless searches, the new detention centers, the new war, the Department of \"Homeland\" (nee Fatherland) Security, the Real ID Act and the wars against Iraq and the pending one against Iran in a new perspective? Doesn\\'t it add a bit of clarity to what you\\'ve been seeing for years?\\n\\nAnd when you hear FOX Noise\\'s nightly drone of propaganda and then you come here and recognize its falsity, aren\\'t you a little bit scared for your country? Aren\\'t you a little worried that so many Americans still believe the lies Bush and his cronies peddle about Iran and Iraq and WMDs and nukes and terra-ists and non-existent plots?\\n\\nDo you think maybe it is designed more toward this kind of creeping totalitarianism than it is in response to any real threat?\\n\\nBecause totalitarianism has its advocates. That seems foreign and weird to those of us who love freedom and have breathed in the sweet milk of democracy, but totalitarianism, tyranny, the destruction of liberty has its friends and advocates and those who would (and do) profit from it.\\n\\nAnd yes, I am an alarmist. And I will keep ringing this bell like Jeremiah kept talking for 40 years, even when no one listened, and even as destruction became certain.

There he was transfigured before them. His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them. And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses, who were talking with Jesus. Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.” (He did not know what to say, they were so frightened.) Then a cloud appeared and covered them, and a voice came from the cloud: “This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!” Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus. As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. They kept the matter to themselves, discussing what “rising from the dead” meant. Mark 9: 1-10\\n\\nSometimes it’s the little things for me. This is a huge moment in human history, the transfiguration of Christ, so huge that we often stick it into a little box in our minds marked, “Religion: Do Not Touch.”\\n\\nSo reading though it this week, the thing that grabbed me was the last verse, where the disciples were trying to figure out what “rising from the dead” meant.\\n\\nThey were resisting Jesus’ predictions of his death. It’s natural that, having blocked out that message, they were unable to think thru to the next thing, the resurrection. But this drags us back to the fact that these guys were NOT religious statues, but eye witnesses of the greatest moments in history. Of course they didn’t know what rising from the dead meant!\\n\\nIt is fragments of authenticity like this verse, that are the deciding factors in court cases. They pull the jury to a realization that they are hearing a true message.\\n\\nWe see the transfiguration in grandiose terms, and we should.

If I\\'m a Democrat, you\\'re not human unless you\\'re a Democrat too. If I\\'m a Republican, you\\'re not human unless you\\'re a Republican too. If I\\'m a Dean supporter, you\\'re not human unless you support Dean too. If I\\'m one color, you\\'re not human unless you\\'re the same color.\\n\\nWe and our predecessors have been harming and killing one another for as long as our species has existed. And every time, the harmful act is preceded by some form of dehumanization.\\n\\nI couldn\\'t harm my friend or my sister. They, after all, are human.\\n\\nI couldn\\'t harm my father. He\\'s human. He\\'s also a Republican. Oddly, I can say and do things against Republicans, and somehow that\\'s not the same as doing or saying something harmful to my father.\\n\\nBut it is.\\n\\nOut of respect for you, dad, I will always confine my vitriol to the mistaken and destructive policies your political party supports. You will always have my unconditional love.\\n\\nHate the sin, love the sinner\\n\\nDuring my 18 years as a Christian, I was trained as an effective evangelist. I learned to talk to people about Christ, to convince them of the value of being saved. One of the central beliefs we held as evangelists was that everyone is essentially good, and perhaps has been led astray by temptation. Our job was to overcome the evil and save the good person. Hate the sin, love the sinner.\\n\\nTo this day, I still believe that all people are essentially good (with some exceptions due to mental illness). I also believe that it is extraordinarily easy to be led to mistaken conclusions with evil results. While there are indeed some genuine psychopaths and sociopaths, the vast majority of humanity means to do good. What goes wrong is how we achieve \"good.\"\\n\\nIt is good to care for my family. So, I look for ways to acquire money to care for them. I purchase some land, and I find that other people want the lumber that can be harvested from the trees on that land. They want to use that wood to build homes. Well, this certainly seems like a win-win, doesn\\'t it? I get money to feed my family, and they get wood to build homes for others.\\n\\nObviously, there is room for tremendous damage in this example. While short-term good may indeed be achieved, there are disastrous consequences in store for excessive and unsustainable logging (as the collapse of the Easter Island civilization demonstrates).\\n\\nThe bottom line here is, never ascribe to malice that which is adequately explained by ignorance. And remember that while both are curable states of being, ignorance is the easier of the two to treat.\\n\\nThe soul of DailyKos\\n\\nI\\'ve been participating in and administrating online communities for several years now. Inevitably, schisms form. Sides are chosen. Inevitably, each side believes it is fighting for the soul of the community.\\n\\nWhat hubris.\\n\\nThe community\\'s soul is the collection of our individual minds. No one \"side\" can rule the soul of a community. Certain ideas can be heard more often than others, yes. Certain users can exert social (or administrative) pressure on others, yes.\\n\\nBut the soul of the DailyKos community is mine and yours, not some token that can be seized by warring factions. Always, always remember this: you are the community. In a very tangible way. What is the community but the combined minds of us all, shared through willful communication?\\n\\nSimilarly, a community has no \"direction\" but the sum of the actions of its individual members. Whither DailyKos? Wherever you and I go today. Period.\\n\\nWe are all different\\n\\nBrian: \"You are all individuals!\"\\n\\nCrowd of worshipers: \"YES YES WE ARE ALL INDIVIDUALS!\"\\n\\nBrian: \"You are all different.\"\\n\\nCrowd: \"YES WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT!\"\\n\\nLone voice: \"I\\'m not.\"\\n\\nPerson next to him: \"SHH!\"\\n\\n-- Monty Python\\'s \"The Life of Brian\"\\n\\nAs a progressive (I guess a label\\'s okay as long as I apply it to myself), one of my highest beliefs is that we are all valuable, respectable, and unique. Even so, I often catch myself lumping people together unjustly.\\n\\nLabeling someone is the beginning of dehumanization, and leads to the sort of oppression that progressive philosophy opposes.\\n\\nIf there is one thing I would impart to you, it is this: We are all individuals. Worthy of respect. Worthy of help. And free to think on our own. Always.\\n\\nRead what you are about to post. Consider what you are about to say.\\n\\nDoes it attack or defend an idea, or a person?\\n\\nIf it attacks a person, is that attack based on that person\\'s membership in some despised group?\\n\\nLet\\'s all open our eyes and keep focused on what is important: the ideas and actions we must champion in order to bring the most good to the most people.\\n\\nLet\\'s focus our attacks on bad ideas and misguided values, and focus our support on good people and constructive values.\\n\\n',\n",

One of the most astonishing articles to appear recently was featured in The WashPost’s outlook section today, Thomas E. Ricks’ “The War in Iraq isn’t over. The main events may not even have happened yet.” Link http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/13/AR2009021301648.html?hpid=opinionsbox1 . Ricks is a professional cheerleader for Generals Petraeus and Odierno, whom he appears to regard as reincarnations of Napoleon and Hannibal all rolled together with a little Ulysses S. Grant. He also is the special military correspondent for the WashPost…need I say more?\\n\\nThe article in question tells us that the Generals expect the US to be in Iraq with a substantial force through 2014 or 2015, the election of Obama and his pledge to withdraw in 18 months notwithstanding. It also ignores the Iraqi demands that we should leave. When I saw Ricks name on the byline I didn’t even want to read the piece, but forced myself to do so. I fully expected a bullshit argument about how the US had to stay in Iraq to oppose terrorism or counter Iran, but was somewhat disappointed. In the course of 3,000 or so words Ricks did not provide a single reason why the United States should remain in Iraq apart from a comment that leaving Iraq would let “the genocidal chips fall where they may.” So the United States is in Iraq to stop genocide. If that is so, we should probably send troops to the Sudan, Sri Lanka, and the Congo just for starters. What we are really seeing is that the generals increasingly have their own agenda and it ain’t bringing the troops home. They provide good access and notable comments to a lot of enablers in the media like Ricks who like a robust story full of blood and guts and want to make sure the good old global war on terror goes on and on. It might be simplistic to ask “If Usama bin Laden is the enemy and he is located in Pakistan why have we been fighting wars for seven years in Iraq and Afghanistan?” Sometimes the simple questions are the only ones worth asking.',\n",

       " ('April 2017 could turn out to be one of the most important months in U.S. history that we have seen in a very long time. On April 6th, Donald Trump attacked Syria on the 100th anniversary of the day that the U.S. officially entered World War I, and now at the end of this month we could be facing an unprecedented political crisis in Washington. On Friday, members of Congress left town for their two week “Easter vacation”, and they won’t resume work until April 25th. What this means is that Congress will have precisely four days when they get back to pass a bill to fund government operations or there will be a government shutdown starting on April 29th.\\n\\nUp to this point, there has been very little urgency by either party to move a spending bill forward. It is almost as if everyone is already resigned to the fact that a government shutdown will happen. The Democrats will greatly benefit from a government shutdown because they can just blame the entire mess on the Republicans. But for the GOP, this is essentially the equivalent of political malpractice.\\n\\nTo me, there is simply no way that Congress is going to be able to agree on a bill that funds the entire government in just four days. And it turns out that this upcoming deadline comes exactly on the 100th day of Trump’s presidency…\\n\\nThe U.S. government is poised to shut down on Day 100 of Donald Trump’s presidency, unless Congress can pass a new spending bill or a continuing resolution before the current one expires on April 28. Since Congress is currently on a two-week recess, there will be a sense of urgency to get a new bill passed once they reconvene on April 25. Leaders in both chambers would have four days to craft a new proposal that each side can agree on and get it on the president’s desk for Trump to sign.\\n\\nIf the Republicans control the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives, why will it be so difficult to get an agreement on a spending bill?\\n\\nWell, first of all, look at how difficult it was for the Republicans to agree on a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. At this point, it doesn’t look like that is going to happen at all.\\n\\nMore importantly, any bill to fund the government is going to require 60 votes in the Senate. The “nuclear option” that the Republicans just used to push the Gorsuch Supreme Court nomination through is not available in this case under current Senate rules because a spending bill of this nature would not qualify.\\n\\nSo the Democrats have leverage, and they plan to use it to the maximum. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is already promising to block any spending bill that includes funds for a border wall or that defunds Planned Parenthood…\\n\\nThe threat from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democratic leaders sets up a climactic first showdown with the president, particularly with their inclusion of Trump’s signature border wall proposal. “If Republicans insist on inserting poison pill riders such as defunding Planned Parenthood, building a border wall, or starting a deportation force, they will be shutting down the government and delivering a severe blow to our economy,” Schumer said in a statement. Up until now, Trump hasn’t needed Democratic votes to stock his cabinet or advance the repeal of Obamacare, but a spending bill keeping the government open is subject to a 60-vote threshold in the Senate.\\n\\nDo you understand what this means?\\n\\nPresident Trump is going to be under an immense amount of pressure to end the government shutdown once it begins, but to do so will mean that he has to give up his goal of getting a border wall.\\n\\nDo you think that Trump will just throw in the towel and forget about his beloved border wall after giving countless speeches promising one?\\n\\nIt is a game of chicken between Trump and the Democrats, and I don’t think that either side will give in easily.\\n\\nOf even greater importance is the debate over the funding of Planned Parenthood.\\n\\nThere are members of the Freedom Caucus that will absolutely not vote for any spending bill that includes funding for Planned Parenthood. But without the Freedom Caucus, there aren’t enough Republican votes to get a spending bill through the House of Representatives.\\n\\nAlternatively, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is vowing that his party will block any funding bill that attempts to defund Planned Parenthood in the Senate.\\n\\nIf Planned Parenthood is not defunded now, it never will be defunded. This is one of the most pivotal moments in recent U.S. political history, and the outcome is going to have extraordinary consequences for our nation.\\n\\nFor those that are optimistic that there will not be a government shutdown, do you actually expect me to believe that this battle over the funding of Planned Parenthood will somehow get resolved in just four days?\\n\\nGive me a break.\\n\\nAnd of course there are dozens of other major issues that have to be resolved as well. For example, Senator McCain is promising note to vote for any bill unless it includes an enormous increase in military spending, while many Senate Democrats would be very much against such a move.\\n\\nI don’t see any way that a government shutdown is going to be avoided at this point, and the longer it goes on the more financial markets are going to get rattled.\\n\\nMeanwhile, we continue to get even more signs that a substantial slowdown has begun for the U.S. economy. Last week, we learned that only 98,000 jobs were added in March, and that was only about half of what most analysts were expecting.\\n\\nAnd since it takes approximately 150,000 jobs a month just to keep up with population growth, that means that we are losing ground.\\n\\nAt the same time, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecasting model is now projecting that U.S. GDP growth for the first quarter of 2017 will be just 0.6 percent on an annualized basis.\\n\\nThat is absolutely pathetic, and as I have said before, I wouldn’t be surprised at all if we actually end up with a negative number for the first quarter.\\n\\nIf we do indeed get a negative number for the first quarter and that is followed by another negative number for the second quarter, that will mean that a new recession has already started right now but we just haven’t gotten official confirmation yet.\\n\\nAnd lots of other things are already happening which have not happened since the last recession. For instance, this is the first time since the last financial crisis when there has been no growth for commercial and industrial lending for at least six months.\\n\\nIn addition, commercial bankruptcies spiked during the last recession, and now it is happening again…\\n\\nCommercial bankruptcy filings, from corporations to sole proprietorships, spiked 28% in March from February, the largest month-to-month move in the data series of the American Bankruptcy Institute going back to 2012.\\n\\nOf course consumer bankruptcies are rising at an alarming rate as well. The following comes from Wolf Richter…\\n\\nIn December, bankruptcy filings rose 4.5% from a year earlier. In January they rose 5.4%. It was the first time consumer bankruptcies rose back-to-back since 2010. I called it “a red flag that’ll be highlighted only afterwards as a turning point.” In March, consumer bankruptcy filings rose 4% year-over-year, to 77,900, the highest since March 2015, when 79,000 filings occurred, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute data. The turning point has now been confirmed.\\n\\nIf you would like, I could keep talking about the bad economic news for a couple thousand more words. U.S. credit card debt has just surpassed the one trillion dollar mark, a major crisis has arrived for the U.S. auto industry, thousands of retail stores are closing all over America, our pension funds are underfunded by trillions of dollars, and the U.S. national debt is now sitting at a grand total that is just shy of 20 trillion dollars. The only reason that we have not crossed that 20 trillion dollar mark yet is because the debt ceiling deadline has already passed, and that is another thing that Congress needs to address very quickly if they want to avoid a major crisis.\\n\\nNeedless to say, the last thing that we need at this point is another war or two on top of everything else.\\n\\nUnfortunately, a U.S. aircraft carrier strike group headed by the USS Carl Vinson is heading toward North Korea right at this moment, and Russia and Iran are promising to “respond with force” to any new U.S. attacks on Syria. I will be writing quite a bit more about all of this on End Of The American Dream later today.\\n\\nThose that were hoping for some sort of “reprieve” under Donald Trump can forget all about that now. The pace of global events is really starting to accelerate, and the U.S. is already in a more precarious position than it was at any point in 2016.\\n\\nThe clouds have been building for a very long time, and now the storm is almost upon us. I hope that you have been getting prepared, because a day of reckoning for the United States of America is closing in very rapidly.',\n",

Even the idiotic Illinois Governor Pat Quinn, a Democrat, did it.\\n\\nNancy Keates reports for the Wall St. Journal, March 19, 2012:\\n\\nThe governor of Illinois did it live on a radio show. Two NBA players were chastised for videotaping it. A school in Pennsylvania banned open-top boots because of it.\\n\\nWhat is it? Swallowing cinnamon.\\n\\nThe so-called cinnamon challenge—a dare to swallow a spoonful of cinnamon without water—has gone viral and beyond. Though the challenge has been around for years, its popularity has spiked recently, to the amusement—or puzzlement—of many.\\n\\nSome 30,000 videos tagged “cinnamon challenge” have been uploaded on to YouTube. The most popular, with almost nine million views, was uploaded last month; it shows a woman with big earrings slurping a pile of brown powder from a soup ladle and immediately, dramatically, spitting it out. A fit of coughing follows.\\n\\nThe difficulty is that the spice doesn’t break down very fast and can get stuck in the throat, causing gagging and even vomiting. Doctors say this can be dangerous because the cinnamon can prevent air from reaching the lungs. “It is an obvious choking hazard and there is a risk of inhaling the dust. This certainly is not advisable,” says a spokesman from the Food and Drug Administration.\\n\\nDr. Jeffrey Cain, president-elect for the American Academy of Family Physicians, says the cinnamon itself isn’t dangerous—but inflammation of the lungs is a real possibility. That, and being laughed at, he says.\\n\\nAs a result, schools from Alabama to Guam are warning parents and staff about the potential dangers of swallowing so much cinnamon at once. “The kids all know about this from the Internet but the parents have no idea,” says Arthur Williams, principal at Huron High School in Ann Arbor, Mich., who emailed parents after a student was recently hospitalized for 4½ days because of lung trouble after trying the challenge.\\n\\nPottstown Middle School in Pottstown, Pa., which has had three reported incidents of students taking the cinnamon challenge on campus since January, caught a student trying to smuggle a vial of cinnamon into school in a pair of boots. The school subsequently put a ban “open-top boots,” also intended to stop cellphone smuggling.\\n\\n“Young people looking for an exciting challenge that could lead to danger is an age-old problem,” says John Armato, 64, community relations director for the Pottstown School District. “It just spreads faster now.”\\n\\nIt isn’t just kids who are doing it. Adults, too, often attract attention inhaling cinnamon.\\n\\n“He’s unbelievable. I don’t believe what he just did. The Governor, I bow before you,” shouted Jonathon Brandmeier, host of WGN-AM radio in Chicago in February, after [Democrat] Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn swallowed cinnamon on air. Mr. Quinn casually raised the spoon to his mouth, ate the cinnamon and then took a big swig of bottled water without a twitch. He then recited a line he often uses: “The will of the people. The law of the land.”\\n\\nA spokesperson for the governor says he was taken by surprise when asked to attempt the challenge.\\n\\nSome do it to raise their online presence. “I wanted the views. I have to do things like torture myself to keep people watching,” says Colleen Ballinger, a 25-year-old comedian whose stage name is Miranda Sings, about her decision to upload her cinnamon challenge attempt. Ms. Ballinger makes money from a percentage of advertising on her YouTube videos. She has 90,000 subscribers to her YouTube channels and a total of 22 million views on her videos.\\n\\nA few weeks ago, hundreds of fans started asking her to take the cinnamon challenge, she says. Others advised against it.\\n\\nMs. Ballinger did it anyway. “I thought everyone was being dramatic. But you really do feel like you’re suffocating,” she says. Her video garnered 70,000 views after one week of posting it.\\n\\nA video uploaded last fall by Washington Wizards players—guard Nick Young and center JaVale McGee—doing the cinnamon challenge was rebroadcast on ABC’s “Good Morning America” as an example of what players were doing during the NBA lockout. The action begins with a close-up of teaspoonfuls of cinnamon and ends with Mr. McGee spitting it out and doubling over.\\n\\n“The biggest thing is they’re not young players anymore. So they have to show the discipline, maturity, not only on the floor but off the floor,” Flip Saunders, the team coach at the time, told reporters at a news conference about the video. A team spokesman declined to comment. A representative for Mr. Young declined to comment, and a representative for Mr. McGee didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nChuck Conry says he tried it because he also didn’t think it could be as bad as everyone made it out to be. The 29-year-old caregiver and online film reviewer from Beech Grove, Tenn., who doesn’t even like cinnamon, describes the experience as similar to “putting a big pile of dirt into your mouth, but with a burn to it.” Once he started filming it, “there was no way I was going to spit it out.”\\n\\nTwitter users offer themselves up as candidates to try the cinnamon challenge on the condition that they get a certain number of “RT”s or “retweets” by other Twitter users—a method of spreading a message more widely that can have the effect of gaining the original Tweeter more followers and earning them online recognition.\\n\\nThe number of times “cinnamon challenge” was mentioned on Twitter went from fewer than 20 per day before December to around 1,000 per day, according to Topsy Labs, a social-media analytics firm in San Francisco. Then it started to really pick up, peaking at just under 70,000 mentions on Jan. 23.\\n\\nCinnamon videos continue to roll in. Many of the videos uploaded on YouTube in the past couple of months are from several years ago.\\n\\nHelping fuel the fire is a Feb. 28 skit on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” getting attention online. Set up as a riff on the Academy Awards. Mr. Kimmel announced a new category: “Achievement in Cinnamontography” and showed three popular cinnamon challenge videos that were on YouTube.\\n\\n~Eowyn\\n\\nAdvertisements',\n",

       " ('Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression?\\n\\n46 million Americans go to food banks, and long lines for dwindling food supplies begin at 6:30 AM Those that run food banks all over America say that demand for their services just continues to explode. It always amazes me that there are still people out there that insist that an “economic collapse” is not happening. From their air-conditioned homes in their cushy suburban neighborhoods they mock the idea that the U.S. economy is crumbling. But if they would just go down and visit the local food banks in their areas, they would see how much people are hurting. According to Feeding America spokesman Ross Fraser, 46 million Americans got food from a food bank at least one time during 2014. Because the demand has become so overwhelming, some food banks are cutting back on the number of days they operate and the amount of food that is given to each family. As you will see below, many impoverished Americans are lining up at food banks as early as 6:30 in the morning just so that they can be sure to get something before the food runs out. And yet there are still many people out there that have the audacity to say that everything is just fine in America. Shame on them for ignoring the pain of millions upon millions of their fellow citizens. Poverty in America is getting worse, not better. And no amount of spin from Barack Obama or his apologists can change that fact. This year, it is being projected that food banks in the United States will give away an all-time record 4 billion pounds of food. Over the past decade, that number has more than doubled. And that number would be even higher if food banks had more food to give away. The demand has become so crushing that some food banks have actually reduced the amount of food each family gets… Food banks across the country are seeing a rising demand for free groceries despite the growing economy, leading some charities to reduce the amount of food they offer each family. Those in need are starting to realize what is going on, so they are getting to the food banks earlier and earlier. For example, one food bank in New Mexico is now getting long lines of people every single day starting at 6:30 in the morning… “We get lines of people every day, starting at 6:30 in the morning,” said Sheila Moore, who oversees food distribution at The Storehouse, the largest pantry in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and one where food distribution has climbed 15 percent in the past year. Does that sound like an “economic recovery” to you? Just because your family doesn’t have to stand in line for food does not mean that everything is okay in America. The same thing that is happening in New Mexico is also happening in Ohio. Needy people are standing in line at the crack of dawn so that they can be sure to get something “before the food runs out”… Lisa Hamler-Fugitt, executive director of the Ohio Association of Food Banks, who has been working in food charities since the 1980s, said that when earlier economic downturns ended, food demand declined, but not this time. “People keep coming earlier and earlier, they’re standing in line, hoping they get there before the food runs out,” Hamler-Fugitt said. And keep in mind that we are just now entering the next global financial crisis and the next major recession. So how bad will things be when millions more Americans lose their jobs and millions more Americans lose their homes? Rising poverty is also reflected in the number of Americans on food stamps. The following graph was posted by the Economic Policy Journal, and it shows how food stamp use has absolutely exploded in the five most populated states… I don’t see an “economic recovery” in that graph, do you? Instead, what it shows is that the number of Americans on food stamps continued to rise for years even after the recession ended. Sadly, things are only going to get worse from here. Eventually, the kinds of things that we are seeing happen in places such as Venezuela will be coming here as well. At this point, young mothers in Venezuela are sleeping outside of empty supermarkets at night in a desperate attempt to get something for their families when morning arrives… As dawn breaks over the scorching Venezuelan city of Maracaibo, smugglers, young mothers and a handful of kids stir outside a supermarket where they spent the night, hoping to be first in line for scarce rice, milk or whatever may be available. Some of the people in line are half-asleep on flattened cardboard boxes, others are drinking coffee. Most Americans cannot identify with this level of suffering, but it is coming to our country someday too. Here is more from Reuters… “I can’t get milk for my child. What are we going to do?” said Leida Silva, 54, breaking into tears outside the Latino supermarket in northern Maracaibo where she arrived at 3 a.m. on a recent day. Just a couple of days ago, I wrote about how the number of Americans living in concentrated areas of high poverty has doubled since the year 2000. In case you are wondering, that is not a sign of progress. Just because you might live in a comfortable neighborhood that does not give you the right to look down on those that are suffering. And when you add increasing racial tensions to the mix, it becomes easier to understand why there is so much anger and frustration in our urban areas. According to Business Insider, the percentage of Americans that consider race relations to be in good shape in this nation has dropped precipitously… Over the last two years there has been a 23% drop in the number of Americans who see relations between blacks and whites as “very good” or “somewhat good.” Today, only 47% of Americans see black-white relations positively, according to a Gallup poll, the lowest it has been in the last 14 years. The poll also showed that blacks see the relations more positively (51%) than whites (45%), but both percentages experienced sharp declines in the last two years. All of the ingredients are there for civil unrest to erupt in cities all over the United States. When the next major economic downturn happens, anger and frustration are going to flare to extremely dangerous levels. At this point, it will not take much to set things off. Desperate people do desperate things, and desperation is rising even now in this country. So how did things get so bad? Stupid decisions lead to stupid results, and very soon we will start to pay a very great price for decades of incredibly stupid decisions.',\n",

       " ('Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression?\\n\\nAre The Government And The Big Banks Quietly Preparing For An Imminent Financial Collapse? Something really strange appears to be happening. All over the globe, governments and big banks are acting as if they are anticipating an imminent financial collapse. Unfortunately, we are not privy to the quiet conversations that are taking place in corporate boardrooms and in the halls of power in places such as Washington D.C. and London, so all we can do is try to make sense of all the clues that are all around us. Of course it is completely possible to misinterpret these clues, but sticking our heads in the sand is not going to do any good either. Last week, it was revealed that the U.S. government has been secretly directing five of the biggest banks in America “to develop plans for staving off collapse” for the last two years. By itself, that wouldn’t be that big of a deal. But when you add that piece to the dozens of other clues of imminent financial collapse, a very troubling picture begins to emerge. Over the past 12 months, hundreds of banking executives have been resigning, corporate insiders have been selling off enormous amounts of stock, and I have been personally told that a significant number of Wall Street bankers have been shopping for “prepper properties” in rural communities this summer. Meanwhile, there have been reports that the U.S. government has been stockpiling food and ammunition, and Barack Obama has been signing a whole bunch of executive orders that would potentially be implemented in the event of a major meltdown of society. So what does all of this mean? It could mean something or it could mean nothing. What we do know is that a financial collapse is coming at some point. Over the past 40 years, the total amount of all debt in the United States has grown from about 2 trillion dollars to nearly 55 trillion dollars. That is a recipe for financial armageddon, and it is inevitable that this gigantic bubble of debt is going to burst at some point. In normal times, the U.S. government does not tell major banks to “develop plans for staving off collapse”. But according to a recent Reuters article, that is apparently exactly what has been happening…. U.S. regulators directed five of the country’s biggest banks, including Bank of America Corp and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, to develop plans for staving off collapse if they faced serious problems, emphasizing that the banks could not count on government help. The two-year-old program, which has been largely secret until now, is in addition to the “living wills” the banks crafted to help regulators dismantle them if they actually do fail. It shows how hard regulators are working to ensure that banks have plans for worst-case scenarios and can act rationally in times of distress. Does it seem odd to anyone else that only five really big banks got such a warning? And why keep it secret from the American public? Does the federal government actually expect such a collapse to happen? If federal officials do expect a financial collapse to occur, they would not be the only ones. An increasing number of very respected economists are speaking about the coming financial collapse as if there is a certain inevitability about it. For example, check out the following quote from a recent Money Morning article…. Richard Duncan, formerly of the World Bank and chief economist at Blackhorse Asset Mgmt., says America’s $16 trillion federal debt has escalated into a “death spiral,” as he told CNBC. And it could result in a depression so severe that he doesn’t “think our civilization could survive it.” A former World Bank executive is warning that our civilization might not survive what is coming? That is pretty chilling. Economist Nouriel Roubini says that he believes that the coming crisis will be even worse than 2008…. “Worse because like 2008 you will have an economic and financial crisis but unlike 2008, you are running out of policy bullets. In 2008, you could cut rates; do QE1, QE2; you could do fiscal stimulus; you could backstop/ringfence/guarantee banks and everybody else. Today, more QEs are becoming less and less effective because the problems are of solvency not liquidity. Fiscal deficits are already so large and you cannot bail out the banks because 1) there is a political opposition to it; and 2) governments are near-insolvent – they cannot bailout themselves let alone their banks. The problem is that we are running out of policy rabbits to pull out of the hat!” Across the pond, many European officials are echoing similar sentiments. What Nigel Farage told King World News the other day is very ominous…. Today MEP (Member European Parliament) Nigel Farage spoke with King World News about what he described as the possibility of, “a really dramatic banking collapse.” Farage also warned that central planners want to enslave and imprison people inside of a ‘New Order,’ and he described the situation as “horrifying.” The situation in Europe continues to get worse and worse. The authorities in Europe have come out with “solution” after “solution”, and yet unemployment continues to skyrocket and economic conditions in the EU have deteriorated very steadily over the past 12 months. If all of that was not bad enough, there are an increasing number of indications that Germany is actually considering leaving the euro. Needless to say, that would be a complete and total disaster for the rest of the eurozone. Of course there are any number of ways that the financial crisis in Europe could potentially play out. But all of the realistic scenarios would be very bad for the global economy. Meanwhile, our resources are dwindling, war in the Middle East could erupt at any moment and our planet is becoming increasingly unstable. The following is from a recent article by Paul B. Farrell on Marketwatch.com…. Fasten your seat belts, soon we’ll all be shocked out of denial. Some unpredictable black swan. A global wake-up call will trigger the Pentagon’s prediction in Fortune a decade ago at the launch of the Iraq War: “By 2020 … an ancient pattern of desperate, all-out wars over food, water, and energy supplies is emerging … warfare defining human life.” It is almost as if a “perfect storm” is brewing. Of course the historic drought that is ravaging food production in the United States this summer is not helping matters either. Another summer or two like this one and we could be looking at a return of Dust Bowl conditions. Anyone that is watching what is going on in the world and is not concerned at all about what is happening is simply being delusional. Recently, a “team of scientists, economists, and geopolitical analysts” examined the current state of the global economic system and the conclusions they reached were absolutely staggering…. One member of this team, Chris Martenson, a pathologist and former VP of a Fortune 300 company, explains their findings: “We found an identical pattern in our debt, total credit market, and money supply that guarantees they’re going to fail. This pattern is nearly the same as in any pyramid scheme, one that escalates exponentially fast before it collapses. Governments around the globe are chiefly responsible. “And what’s really disturbing about these findings is that the pattern isn’t limited to our economy. We found the same catastrophic pattern in our energy, food, and water systems as well.” According to Martenson: “These systems could all implode at the same time. Food, water, energy, money. Everything.” Hmmmm – it sounds like they have been reading The Economic Collapse Blog. The truth is that a massive worldwide financial collapse is coming. It is inevitable, and it is going to be extremely painful. So what do you think about all of this? Please feel free to post a comment with your thoughts below….',\n",

       " ('Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression?\\n\\nFederal Reserve Whistleblower Tells America The REAL Reason For Quantitative Easing A banker named Andrew Huszar that helped manage the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing program during 2009 and 2010 is publicly apologizing for what he has done. He says that quantitative easing has accomplished next to nothing for the average person on the street. Instead, he says that it has been “the greatest backdoor Wall Street bailout of all time.” And of course the cold, hard economic numbers support what Huszar is saying. The percentage of working age Americans with a job has not improved at all during the quantitative easing era, and median household income has actually steadily declined during that time frame. Meanwhile, U.S. stock prices have doubled overall, and the stock prices of the big Wall Street banks have tripled. So who benefits from quantitative easing? It doesn’t take a genius to figure it out, and now Andrew Huszar is blowing the whistle on the whole thing. From 2009 to 2010, Huszar was responsible for managing the Fed’s purchase of approximately $1.25 trillion worth of mortgage-backed securities. At the time, he thought that it was a dream job, but now he is apologizing to the rest of the country for what happened… I can only say: I’m sorry, America. As a former Federal Reserve official, I was responsible for executing the centerpiece program of the Fed’s first plunge into the bond-buying experiment known as quantitative easing. The central bank continues to spin QE as a tool for helping Main Street. But I’ve come to recognize the program for what it really is: the greatest backdoor Wall Street bailout of all time. When the first round of quantitative easing ended, Huszar says that it was incredibly obvious that QE had done very little to benefit average Americans but that it had been “an absolute coup for Wall Street”… Trading for the first round of QE ended on March 31, 2010. The final results confirmed that, while there had been only trivial relief for Main Street, the U.S. central bank’s bond purchases had been an absolute coup for Wall Street. The banks hadn’t just benefited from the lower cost of making loans. They’d also enjoyed huge capital gains on the rising values of their securities holdings and fat commissions from brokering most of the Fed’s QE transactions. Wall Street had experienced its most profitable year ever in 2009, and 2010 was starting off in much the same way. You’d think the Fed would have finally stopped to question the wisdom of QE. Think again. Only a few months later—after a 14% drop in the U.S. stock market and renewed weakening in the banking sector—the Fed announced a new round of bond buying: QE2. Germany’s finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, immediately called the decision “clueless.” That was when I realized the Fed had lost any remaining ability to think independently from Wall Street. Of course the fact that the Fed cannot think independently from Wall Street should not be a surprise to any of my regular readers. As I have written about repeatedly, the Federal Reserve was created by the Wall Street bankers for the benefit of the Wall Street bankers. When the Federal Reserve serves the interests of Wall Street, it is simply doing what it was designed to do. And according to Huszar, quantitative easing has been one giant “subsidy” for Wall Street banks… Having racked up hundreds of billions of dollars in opaque Fed subsidies, U.S. banks have seen their collective stock price triple since March 2009. The biggest ones have only become more of a cartel: 0.2% of them now control more than 70% of the U.S. bank assets. But Huszar is certainly not the only one on Wall Street that acknowledges these things. For example, just check out what billionaire hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller told CNBC about quantitative easing… “This is fantastic for every rich person,” he said Thursday, a day after the Fed’s stunning decision to delay tightening its monetary policy. “This is the biggest redistribution of wealth from the middle class and the poor to the rich ever.” “Who owns assets—the rich, the billionaires. You think Warren Buffett hates this stuff? You think I hate this stuff? I had a very good day yesterday.” Druckenmiller, whose net worth is estimated at more than $2 billion, said that the implication of the Fed’s policy is that the rich will spend their wealth and create jobs—essentially betting on “trickle-down economics.” “I mean, maybe this trickle-down monetary policy that gives money to billionaires and hopefully we go spend it is going to work,” he said. “But it hasn’t worked for five years.” And Donald Trump said essentially the same thing when he made the following statement on CNBC about quantitative easing… “People like me will benefit from this.” The American people are still being told that quantitative easing is “economic stimulus” which will make the lives of average Americans better. That is a flat out lie and the folks over at the Federal Reserve know this. In fact, a very interesting study conducted for the Bank of England shows that quantitative easing actually increases the gap between the wealthy and the poor… It said that the Bank of England’s policies of quantitative easing – similar to the Fed’s – had benefited mainly the wealthy. Specifically, it said that its QE program had boosted the value of stocks and bonds by 26 percent, or about $970 billion. It said that about 40 percent of those gains went to the richest 5 percent of British households. Many said the BOE’s easing added to social anger and unrest. Dhaval Joshi, of BCA Research wrote that “QE cash ends up overwhelmingly in profits, thereby exacerbating already extreme income inequality and the consequent social tensions that arise from it.” And this is exactly what has happened in the United States as well. U.S. stocks have risen 108% while Barack Obama has been in the White House. And who owns stocks? The wealthy do. In fact, 82 percent of all individually held stocks are owned by the wealthiest 5 percent of all Americans. Meanwhile, things have continued to get even tougher for ordinary Americans. While Obama has been in the White House, the percentage of working age Americans with a job has declined from 60.6% to 58.3%, median household income has declined for five years in a row, and poverty has been absolutely exploding. But the fact that it has been very good for Wall Street while doing essentially nothing for ordinary Americans is not the biggest problem with quantitative easing. The biggest problem with quantitative easing is that it is destroying worldwide faith in the U.S. dollar and in the U.S. financial system. In recent years, the Federal Reserve has started to behave like the Weimar Republic. Just check out the chart below… The rest of the world is watching the Fed go crazy, and they are beginning to openly wonder why they should continue to use the U.S. dollar as the de facto reserve currency of the planet. Right now, most global trade involves the use of U.S. dollars. In fact, far more U.S. dollars are actually used outside of the United States than are used inside the country. This creates a tremendous demand for U.S. dollars around the planet, and it keeps the value of the U.S. dollar at a level that is far higher than it otherwise would be. If the rest of the world decides to start moving away from the U.S. dollar (and this is already starting to happen), then the demand for the U.S. dollar will fall and we will not be able to import oil from the Middle East and cheap plastic trinkets from China so inexpensively anymore. In addition, major exporting nations such as China and Saudi Arabia end up with giant piles of U.S. dollars due to their trading activities. Instead of just sitting on all of that cash, they tend to reinvest much of it back into U.S. Treasury securities. This increases demand for U.S. debt and drives down interest rates. If the Federal Reserve continues to wildly create money out of thin air with no end in sight, the rest of the world may decide to stop lending us trillions of dollars at ultra-low interest rates. When we get to that point, it is going to be absolutely disastrous for the U.S. economy and the U.S. financial system. If you doubt this, just read this article. The only way that the game can continue is for the rest of the world to continue to be irrational and to continue to ignore the reckless behavior of the Federal Reserve. We desperately need the rest of the planet “to ignore the man behind the curtain”. We desperately need them to keep using our dollars that are rapidly being devalued and to keep loaning us money at rates that are far below the real rate of inflation. If the rest of the globe starts behaving rationally at some point, and they eventually will, then the game will be over. Let us hope and pray that we still have a bit more time until that happens.',\n",

       " ('Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression?\\n\\nGreece Says That It Will Default On June 5th, And Moody’s Warns Of A ‘Deposit Freeze’ The Greek government says that a “moment of truth” is coming on June 5th. Either their lenders agree to give them more money by that date, or Greece will default on a 300 million euro loan payment to the IMF. Of course it won’t technically be a “default” according to IMF rules for another 30 days after that, but without a doubt news that Greece cannot pay will send shockwaves throughout the financial world. At that point, those holding Greek bonds will start to panic as they realize that they might not get paid as well. All over Europe, there are major banks that are holding large amounts of Greek debt and derivatives that are related to the performance of Greek debt. If something is not done to avert disaster at the last moment, a default by Greece could be the spark that sets off a major European financial crisis this summer. As I discussed the other day, neither the EU nor the IMF have given any money to Greece since August 2014. So now the Greek government is just about out of money, and without any new loans they will not be able to pay back the old loans that are coming due. In fact, things are so bad at this point that the Greek government is openly warning that it will default on June 5th… Greece cannot make an upcoming payment to the International Monetary Fund on June 5 unless foreign lenders disburse more aid, a senior ruling party lawmaker said on Wednesday, the latest warning from Athens it is on the verge of default. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s leftist government says it hopes to reach a cash-for-reforms deal in days, although European Union and IMF lenders are more pessimistic and say talks are moving too slowly for that. Of course this is all part of a very high stakes chess game. The Greeks believe that the Germans will back down when faced with the prospect of a full blown European financial crisis, and the Germans believe that the Greeks will eventually be feeling so much pain that they will be forced to give in to their demands. So with each day we get closer and closer to the edge, and the Greeks are trying to do their best to let everyone know that they are not bluffing. Just today, a spokesperson for the Greek government came out and declared that unless there is a deal by June 5th, the IMF “won’t get any money”… Greek officials now point to a race against the clock to clinch a deal before payments totaling about 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) to the IMF come due next month, starting with a 300 million euro payment on June 5. “Now is the moment that negotiations are coming to a head. Now is the moment of truth, on June 5,” Nikos Filis, spokesman for the ruling Syriza party’s lawmakers, told ANT1 television. “If there is no deal by then that will address the current funding problem, they won’t get any money,” he said. But the Germans know that the Greeks desperately need more money and can’t last much longer. The Greek banking system is so close to collapse that Moody’s just downgraded it again and warned that “there is a high likelihood of an imposition of capital controls and a deposit freeze” in the months ahead… The outlook for the Greek banking system is negative, primarily reflecting the acute deterioration in Greek banks’ funding and liquidity, says Moody’s Investors Service in a new report published recently. These pressures are unlikely to ease over the next 12-18 months and there is a high likelihood of an imposition of capital controls and a deposit freeze. The new report: “Banking System Outlook: Greece”, is now available on www.moodys.com. Moody’s subscribers can access this report via the link provided at the end of this press release. Moody’s notes that significant deposit outflows of more than €30 billion since December 2014 have increased banks’ dependence on central bank funding. In our view, the banks are likely to remain highly dependent on central bank funding, as ongoing uncertainty regarding Greece’s support programme continues to compromise depositors’ confidence. Unfortunately, when things really start going crazy in Greece people might be faced with much more than just frozen bank accounts. As I wrote about just a few days ago, there is a very strong possibility that we could actually see Cyprus-style wealth confiscation implemented in Greece when the banks collapse. In fact, the Greek government is already talking about the possibility of a special tax on banking transactions… Athens is promoting the idea of a special levy on banking transactions at a rate of 0.1-0.2 percent, while the government’s proposal for a two-tier value-added tax – depending on whether the payment is in cash or by card – has met with strong opposition from the country’s creditors. A senior government official told Kathimerini that among the proposals discussed with the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund is the imposition of a levy on bank transactions, whose exact rate will depend on the exemptions that would apply. The aim is to collect 300-600 million euros on a yearly basis. Fee won’t include ATM withdrawals, transactions up to EU500; in this case Greek govt projects EU300m-EU600m annual revenue from measure. Sadly, most people living in North America (which is most of my audience) does not really care much about what happens on the other side of the world. But they should care. If Greece defaults and the Greek banking system collapses, stocks and bonds will crash all over Europe. Many believe that such a crash can be “contained” to just Europe, but that is really just wishful thinking. In addition, the euro would plummet dramatically, which would cause substantial financial problems all over the planet. As I recently explained, the euro is headed to parity with the U.S. dollar and then it is going to go below parity. Before it is all said and done, the euro is going to all-time lows. Of course the U.S. dollar is eventually going to totally collapse as well, but that comes later and that is a story for another day. According to the Bank for International Settlements, 74 trillion dollars in derivatives are directly tied to the value of the euro, the value of the U.S. dollar and the value of other global currencies. So if you believe that what is happening in Greece cannot have massive ramifications for the entire global financial system, you are dead wrong. What is happening in Greece is exceedingly important, and it is time for all of us to start paying attention.',\n",

       " ('Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression?\\n\\nIf A Few Ebola Cases Can Make The Stock Market Crash This Much, What Would A Full-Blown Pandemic Mean? Is Ebola going to cause another of the massive October stock market crashes that Wall Street is famous for? At one point on Wednesday, the Dow was down a staggering 460 points. It ultimately closed down just 173 points, but this was the fifth day in a row that the Dow has declined. And of course Ebola is one of the primary things that is being blamed for this stunning stock market drop. Since September 19th, we have seen the S&P 500 fall about 7 percent and the Nasdaq fall nearly 10 percent. The VIX (the most important measure of volatility on Wall Street) shot up an astounding 22 percent on Wednesday. So many of the ominous signs for the markets that I wrote about on Tuesday are now even worse. If a handful of Ebola cases in the United States can cause this much panic in the financial world, what would a full-blown pandemic look like? Of course Ebola is not the only reason why stocks are declining. Just look at what is happening over in Europe. The European Stoxx 600 index is already down a whopping 11.4 percent from the high that it hit just 18 days ago. That is officially considered to be “correction” territory. And Greece experienced a full-blown stock market collapse on Wednesday… As if the world didn’t have enough to be worried about (ISIS, Ebola, slowing China, Ukraine, slowing Germany, Fed tightening, etc.) now look what’s back: Greece. And in a big way. The stock market is down over 9% on Wednesday, which is about as big as crashes come. And the banks are getting absolutely smashed. In general, markets tend to fall faster than they rise. When there is a sudden downturn, the price action can be violent. And just like we saw back in 2008, financial stocks are leading the way. Just check out what happened to some of the biggest banks in America before the final bell sounded… Volume leader Bank of America, down 5%, Citigroup, off 5.5%, and JP Morgan, down 4.6%, were particularly hard hit. And thanks to Ebola fears, airline stocks plummeted as well… Airline stocks were roiled by the prospects of curtailed travel due to the spreading Ebola virus. United Continental fell 4% and American Airlines was off 4.3%. Among tech stocks, Intel lost 3.3%. Apple fell 1.7% and Microsoft slipped 2.3%. An increasing number of voices are concerned that we could be on the verge of a repeat of what happened back in 2008. For example, Professor Steve Keen, the head of Economics, History & Politics at Kingston University in London, wrote the following in a piece for CNN entitled “Brace yourself for another financial crash“… My acceleration indicator has been flagging that the stock market was due for a fall since mid-2013. It’s a tribute to the power of the Fed’s Quantitative Easing that the market continued to defy the gravity of decelerating debt for so long. QE was really a program to inflate asset prices since, as my colleague Michael Hudson puts it, “the Fed’s helicopter money fell on Wall Street, not Main Street”. But with QE being unwound, the stock market is now back under the control of the not so tender mercies of excessive private debt. So welcome to the New Crisis — same as the Old Crisis. The roller coaster ride is likely to continue. Others are even more pessimistic. For example, just check out what Daniel Ameduri of Future Money Trends recently told his readers… “If it drops below 15,000 points I would suggest people start buying food and ammo, because this depression is about to turn nasty.” However, keep in mind that not that much has really changed from a month or two ago. Yes, we now have had three confirmed cases of Ebola in the United States, but this could be just the beginning. At first, the fear of Ebola will be worse than the disease. But if a worst-case scenario does develop in the United States where hundreds of thousands of people are getting the virus, the fear such a pandemic will create will be off the charts. In the midst of a full-blown Ebola pandemic, we wouldn’t just be talking about a 10 percent, 20 percent or 30 percent stock market decline. Rather, we would be talking about the greatest stock market collapse in the history of stock market collapses. In essence, there would not be much of a market at all at that point. And if Ebola does start spreading wildly in this country, we would have a credit crunch that would make 2008 look like a Sunday picnic. During times of extraordinary fear, financial institutions do not want to lend money to each other or to consumers. But our economy is entirely based on debt. If credit were to stop flowing, we would essentially not have an economy. That is why we need to pray that this Ebola crisis stops here. But thanks to the incompetence of Barack Obama and the CDC, there has been a series of very grave errors in trying to contain this disease. This display of incompetence would be absolutely hilarious if we weren’t talking about a disease that could potentially kill millions of us. Let us hope for the best, but let us also prepare for the worst. That means stocking up on the food and supplies that you will need to stay isolated for an extended period of time. As we have seen so many times in the past, basic essentials fly off of store shelves during any type of an emergency. During an extended Ebola pandemic, those essentials would be in very short supply and prices on the basics would absolutely skyrocket. Those that have taken the time to get prepared now will be way ahead of the game. And if there were dozens or hundreds of people in your community that were contagious, you would definitely not want to go to a grocery store or anywhere else where large numbers of people circulate. The key during any major pandemic is to keep yourself and your family isolated from the virus. This is basic common sense, but it is something that Barack Obama does not seem to understand. As I write this, he still has not done anything to restrict air travel between the United States and West Africa. Hopefully this very foolish decision will not result in scores of dead Americans.',\n",

       " ('Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression?\\n\\nThe Big Dogs On Wall Street Are Starting To Get Very Nervous Why are some of the biggest names in the corporate world unloading stock like there is no tomorrow, and why are some of the most prominent investors on Wall Street loudly warning about the possibility of a market crash? Should we be alarmed that the big dogs on Wall Street are starting to get very nervous? In a previous article, I got very excited about a report that indicated that corporate insiders were selling nine times more of their own shares than they were buying. Well, according to a brand new Bloomberg article, insider sales of stock have outnumbered insider purchases of stock by a ratio of twelve to one over the past three months. That is highly unusual. And right now some of the most respected investors in the financial world are ringing the alarm bells. Dennis Gartman says that it is time to “rush to the sidelines”, Seth Klarman is warning about “the un-abating risks of collapse”, and Doug Kass is proclaiming that “we’re headed for a sharp fall”. So does all of this mean that a market crash is definitely on the way? No, but when you combine all of this with the weak economic data constantly coming out of the U.S. and Europe, it certainly does not paint a pretty picture. According to Bloomberg, it has been two years since we have seen insider sales of stock at this level. And when insider sales of stock are this high, that usually means that the market is about to decline… Corporate executives are taking advantage of near-record U.S. stock prices by selling shares in their companies at the fastest pace in two years. There were about 12 stock-sale announcements over the past three months for every purchase by insiders at Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) companies, the highest ratio since January 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Pavilion Global Markets. Whenever the ratio exceeded 11 in the past, the benchmark index declined 5.9 percent on average in the next six months, according to Pavilion, a Montreal-based trading firm. But it isn’t just the number of stock sales that is alarming. Some of these insider transactions are absolutely huge. Just check out these numbers… Among the biggest transactions last week were a $65.2 million sale by Google Inc.’s 39-year-old Chief Executive Officer Larry Page, a $40.1 million disposal by News Corp.’s 81- year-old Chairman and CEO Rupert Murdoch and a $34.2 million sale from American Express Co. chief Kenneth Chenault, who is 61. Nolan Archibald, the 69-year-old chairman of Stanley Black & Decker Inc. who plans to leave his post next month, unloaded $29.7 million in shares last week and Amphenol Corp. Chairman Martin Hans Loeffler, 68, sold $27.5 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Google Chairman Eric Schmidt, 57, announced plans to sell as many as 3.2 million shares in the operator of the world’s most-popular search engine. The planned share sales, worth about $2.5 billion, represent about 42 percent of Schmidt’s holdings. So why are all of these very prominent executives cashing out all of a sudden? That is a very good question. Meanwhile, some of the most respected names on Wall Street are warning that it is time to get out of the market. For example, investor Dennis Gartman recently wrote that the game is “changing” and that it is time to “rush to the sidelines”… “When tectonic plates in the earth’s crust shift earthquakes happen and when the tectonic plants shift beneath our feet in the capital markets margin calls take place. The tectonic plates have shifted and attention… very careful and very substantive attention… must be paid. “Simply put, the game has changed and where we were playing a ‘game’ fueled by the monetary authorities and fueled by the urge on the part of participants to see and believe in rising ‘animal spirits’ as Lord Keynes referred to them we played bullishly of equities and of the EUR and of ‘risk assets’. Now, with the game changing, our tools have to change and so too our perspective. “Where we were buyers of equities previously we must disdain them henceforth. Where we were sellers of Yen and US dollars we must buy them now. Where we had been long of gold in Yen terms, we must shift that and turn bullish of gold in EUR terms. Where we might have been ‘technically’ bullish of the EUR we must now be technically and fundamentally bearish of it. The game board has been flipped over; the game has changed… change with it or perish. We cannot be more blunt than that.” That is a very ominous warning, but he is far from alone. Just the other day, I wrote about how legendary investor Seth Klarman is warning that the collapse of the financial markets could happen at literally any time… “Investing today may well be harder than it has been at any time in our three decades of existence,” writes Seth Klarman in his year-end letter. The Fed’s “relentless interventions and manipulations” have left few purchase targets for Baupost, he laments. “(The) underpinnings of our economy and financial system are so precarious that the un-abating risks of collapse dwarf all other factors.” Other big hitters on Wall Street are ringing the alarm bells as well. For example, Seabreeze Partners portfolio manager Doug Kass recently told CNBC that what he is seeing right now reminds him of the period just before the crash of 1987… “I’m getting the ‘summer of 1987 feeling’ in the U.S. equity market,” Kass told CNBC, “which means we’re headed for a sharp fall.” And of course the “perma-bears” continue to warn that the months ahead are going to be very difficult. For instance, “Dr. Doom” Marc Faber recently said that he “loves the high odds of a ‘big-time’ market crash“. Another “perma-bear”, Nomura’s Bob Janjuah, is convinced that the stock market will experience one more huge spike before collapsing by up to 50%… I continue to believe that the S&P500 can trade up towards the 1575/1550 area, where we have, so far, a grand double top. I would not be surprised to see the S&P trade marginally through the 2007 all-time nominal high (the real high was of course seen over a decade ago – so much for equities as a long-term vehicle for wealth creation!). A weekly close at a new all-time high would I think lead to the final parabolic spike up which creates the kind of positioning extreme and leverage extreme needed to create the conditions for a 25% to 50% collapse in equities over the rest of 2013 and 2014, driven by real economy reality hitting home, and by policymaker failure/loss of faith in “their system”. So are they right? We will see. At the same time that many of the big dogs are pulling their money out of the market, many smaller investors are rushing to put their money back in to the market. The mainstream media continues to assure them that everything is wonderful and that this rally can last forever. But it is important to keep in mind that the last time that Wall Street was this “euphoric” was right before the market crash in 2008. So what should we be watching for? As I have mentioned before, it is very important to watch the financial markets in Europe right now. If they crash, the financial markets in the U.S. will probably crash too. And the financial markets in Europe definitely have had a rough week. Just check out what happened on Thursday. The following is from a report by CNBC’s Bob Pisani… Italy, Germany, France, Spain, U.K., Greece, and Portugal all on track to log worst day since Feb. 4. European PMI numbers were disappointing, with all major countries except Germany reporting numbers below 50, indicating contraction. What does this mean? It means Europe remains mired in recession: “The euro zone is on course to contract for a fourth consecutive quarter,” Markit, who provides the PMI data, said. A new insight is that France is now joining the weakness shown in periphery countries. You’re giving me agita: Italy was the worst market, down 2.5 percent. The CEO of banking company, Intesa Sanpaolo, said Italy’s recession has been so bad it could cause a fifth of Italian companies to fail, noting that topline for those bottom fifth have been shrinking 35 to 45 percent. Italian elections are this weekend. It wasn’t any better in Asia. The Shanghai Index had its worst day in over a year, closing down nearly three percent. And the economic numbers coming out of the U.S. also continue to be quite depressing. On Thursday, the Department of Labor announced that there were 362,000 initial claims for unemployment benefits during the week ending February 16th. That was a sharp rise from a week earlier. But I am not really concerned about that number yet. When it rises above 400,000 and it stays there, then it will be time to officially become alarmed. So what is the bottom line? There are trouble signs on the horizon for the financial markets. Nobody should panic right now, but things certainly do not look very promising for the remainder of the year.',\n",

       " ('Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression?\\n\\nThe Dow And S&P 500 Soar To Irrational Heights – Meanwhile The Ultra-Wealthy Rush To Buy Gold Bars Did you know that the number of gold bars being purchased by ultra-wealthy individuals has increased by 243 percent so far this year? If stocks are just going to keep soaring, why are they doing this? On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 both closed at record highs once again. It is a party that never seems to end, and there are a lot of really happy people on Wall Street these days. But those that are discerning realize that we witnessed the exact same kind of bubble behavior during the dotcom boom and during the run up to the last financial crash in 2007. The irrational exuberance that we are witnessing right now cannot go on forever. And the bigger that this bubble gets, the more painful that it is going to be when it finally bursts. Those that get out at the peaks of the market are the ones that usually end up making lots of money. Those that ride stocks all the way up and all the way down are the ones that usually end up getting totally wiped out. To get an idea of how irrational the markets have become, all one has to do is to look at Twitter. Would you value “a horribly mismanaged company” that is less than 10 years old and that has never made a yearly profit at 31 billion dollars? Well, that is precisely how much the financial markets say that Twitter is worth at this moment. Even though Twitter will probably never be much more popular than it is right now, it continues to bleed money profusely. On a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis, Twitter lost an astounding 145 million dollars during the second quarter of 2014… Twitter’s GAAP net loss totaled $145 million, up from $42 million a year ago. On a GAAP basis, Twitter lost $0.24 per share. Investors, however, were not expecting Twitter to be profitable by GAAP measurements, so the loss isn’t too much of a drag. Why would anyone want to invest in such a money pit? Here are some more disturbing financial numbers about Twitter from David Stockman… Currently, Twitter (TWTR) is valued at $31 billion.That’s 18X revenue, but the catch is that the revenue in question is it’s lifetime bookings over the 18 quarters since Q1 2010. When it comes to profits, the numbers are not nearly so promising! For the LTM period ending in June, TWTR booked $974 million of revenue and $1.7 billion of operating expense. That why “NM” shows up in its LTM ratio of enterprise value to EBITDA. It turns out that its EBITDA was -$704 million. In fact, its R&D expense alone was 83% of revenues. Of course the truth is that Twitter should be able to make money. And it probably would be making money if it was being managed better. The following is what Silicon Valley venture capitalist Peter Thiel said about Twitter on CNBC the other day… “It’s a horribly mismanaged company — probably a lot of pot-smoking going on there.” But because Twitter is a “hot tech stock” investors are literally throwing money at it. And there are many other tech companies that have similar stories. Off the top of my head, Snapchat, LinkedIn, Yelp and Pinterest come to mind. Fueled by the quantitative easing policies of the Federal Reserve, U.S. stocks have enjoyed an unprecedented joy ride. However, as David Stockman recently told Yahoo Finance, the subsequent crash is likely to be enormously painful… “I think what the Fed is doing is so unprecedented, what is happening in the markets is so unnatural,” he said. “This is dangerous, combustible stuff, and I don’t know when the explosion occurs – when the collapse suddenly is upon us – but when it happens, people will be happy that they got out of the way if they did.” The behavior that we are observing in the stock market simply does not reflect what is happening in the economy overall whatsoever. In many ways, U.S. economic fundamentals just continue to get even worse. Small business ownership in the United States is at an all-time low, the labor force participation rate is the lowest that it has been in 36 years, and the U.S. national debt has grown by more than a trillion dollars over the past 12 months. But on Wall Street right now, there is very little fear that the party is going to end any time soon. The following is how Seth Klarman recently described the market complacency that he is seeing at the moment… To put it a bit differently, writer and investor John Mauldin is right when he says that there is “a bubble in complacency.” Fear has effectively been banished. The members of the Fed know it. Stock traders who chase the market to new highs almost daily know it. Implied volatilities (and realized volatilities) are historically low (the VIX Index recently hit a seven-year low), and falling. The Bank for International Settlements recently cautioned that financial markets are euphoric and in the grip of an aggressive search for yield. The S&P has gone over 1,000 days without a 10% decline, according to Birinyi Associates. Dutch and French 10-year government bond yields are at 500 and 250 year lows, respectively; Spain, 225 years. Spanish debt yields were recently inside of U.S. levels. But as Klarman also observed, just because “investors have been seduced into feeling good” does not mean that this current bubble is any different from what we witnessed back in 2007… It’s not hard to reach the conclusion that so many investors feel good not because things are good but because investors have been seduced into feeling good—otherwise known as “the wealth effect.” We really are far along in re-creating the markets of 2007, which felt great but were deeply unstable when shocks started to pile up. Even Janet Yellen sees “pockets of increasing risk-taking” in the markets, yet she has made clear that she won’t raise rates to fight incipient bubbles. For all of our sakes, we really wish she would. Meanwhile, the ultra-wealthy are making moves to protect themselves from the inevitable chaos that is coming. For example, the Telegraph recently reported that sales of gold bars to wealthy customers are up 243 percent so far in 2014… The super-rich are looking to protect their wealth through buying record numbers of “Italian job” style gold bars, according to bullion experts. The number of 12.5kg gold bars being bought by wealthy customers has increased 243 percent so far this year, when compared to the same period last year, said Rob Halliday-Stein founder of BullionByPost. “These gold bars are usually stored in the vaults of central banks and are the same ones you see in the film ‘The Italian Job’,” added David Cousins, bullion executive from London based ATS Bullion. Do they know something that we don’t? The ultra-wealthy are able to stay ultra-wealthy for a reason. They are usually a step or two ahead of most of the rest of us. And any rational person should be able to see that this financial bubble is going to end very, very badly.',\n",

       " ('Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression?\\n\\nThe Next Financial Crisis Has Already Arrived In Europe, And People Are Starting To Freak Out Did you know that the sixth largest bank in Spain failed in spectacular fashion just a few days ago? Many are comparing the sudden implosion of Banco Popular to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, and EU regulators hastily arranged a sale of the failed bank to Santander in order to avoid a full scale financial panic. Sadly, most Americans have no idea that a new financial crisis is starting to play out over in Europe, because most Americans only care about what is going on in America. But we should be paying attention, because the EU is the second largest economy on the entire planet, and the euro is the second most used currency on the entire planet. The U.S. financial system is already teetering on the brink of disaster, and this new financial crisis in Europe could turn out to be enough to push us over the edge. If EU regulators had not arranged a “forced sale” of Banco Popular to Santander, we would probably be witnessing panic on a scale that we haven’t seen since 2008 in Europe right about now. The following comes from the Telegraph… Spanish banking giant Santander has stepped in to the rescue ailing rival Banco Popular by taking over the failing lender for €1 in a watershed deal masterminded by EU regulators to avoid a damaging collapse. Santander will tap its shareholders for €7bn in a rights issue to raise the capital needed to shore-up Popular’s finances in a dramatic private sector rescue of Spain’s sixth-largest lender. It will inflict losses of approximately €3.3bn on bond investors and shareholders but crucially will avoid a taxpayer bailout. But now that a “too big to fail” bank like Banco Popular has failed, investors are immediately trying to figure out which major Spanish banks may be the next to collapse. According to Wolf Richter, many have identified Liberbank as an institution that is highly vulnerable… After its most tumultuous week since the bailout days of 2012, Spain’s banking system is gripped by a climate of fear, uncertainty and distrust. Rather than allaying investor nerves, the shotgun bail-in and sale of Banco Popular to Santander on Tuesday has merely intensified them. For the first time since the Global Financial Crisis, shareholders and subordinate bondholders of a failing Spanish bank were not bailed out by taxpayers; they took risks in order to make a buck, and they bore the consequences. That’s how it should be. But bank investors don’t like not getting bailed out. Now they’re worrying it could happen again. As Popular’s final days showed, once confidence and trust in a bank vanishes, it’s almost impossible to restore them. The fear has now spread to Spain’s eighth largest lender, Liberbank, a mini-Bankia that was spawned in 2011 from the forced marriage of three failed cajas (savings banks), Cajastur, Caja de Extremadura and Caja Cantabria. On Thursday, shares of Liberbank dropped by an astounding 20 percent, and that was followed up by another 19 percent decline on Friday. Spanish authorities responded by banning short sales of Liberbank shares, and that caused a short-term rebound in the stock price. But we haven’t seen this kind of chaos in European financial markets in a very long time. Meanwhile, Nick Giambruno is sounding the alarm about a much bigger bubble. At this moment, more than a trillion dollars worth of Italian government bonds have negative yields… Over $1 trillion worth of Italian bonds actually have negative yields. It’s a bizarre and perverse situation. Lending money to the bankrupt Italian government carries huge risks. So the yields on Italian government bonds should be near record highs, not record lows. Negative yields could not exist in a free market. They’re only possible in the current “Alice in Wonderland” economy created by central bankers. You see, the European Central Bank (ECB) has been printing money to buy Italian government bonds hand over fist. Since 2008, the ECB and Italian banks have bought over 88% of Italian government debt, according to a recent study. The moment that the ECB stops wildly buying Italian bonds, the party will be over and the Italian financial system will crash. Unfortunately for Italy, the Germans are pressuring the ECB to quit printing so much money, and the Germans usually get their way in these things. But if the Germans get their way this time, we could be facing a complete and utter nightmare very quickly. Here is more from Nick Giambruno… Once the ECB—the only large buyer—steps away, Italian government bonds will crash and rates will soar. Soon it will be impossible for the Italian government to finance itself. Italian banks—which are already insolvent—will be decimated. They hold an estimated €235 billion worth of Italian government bonds. So the coming bond crash will pummel their balance sheets. It’s shaping up to be a lovely train wreck. And all of this is happening in the context of a global economy that appears to be headed for a major downturn. For example, the last time that global credit growth showed down this rapidly was during the last financial crisis… From peak to trough the deceleration in global credit growth is now approaching that during the global financial crisis (-6% of global GDP), even if the dispersion of the decline is much narrower. Currently 55% of the countries in our sample have experienced a -0.3 standard deviation deterioration in their credit impulse (median over 12 months) compared to 77% of countries in Dec ’09 when the median decline was -1.4 stdev.” Of course the last time global credit growth decelerated this dramatically, global central banks intervened on a scale that was unlike anything that we had ever seen before. But this time around it is happening at a time when global central banks are very low on ammo… More importantly, back in 2009, not only China, but the Fed and other central banks unleashed the biggest injection of credit, i.e. liquidity, the world has ever seen resulting in the biggest asset bubble the world has ever seen. And, this time around, the Fed is set to hike for the third time in the past year, even as the ECB and BOJ are forced to soon taper as they run out of eligible bonds to monetize. All this comes at a time when US loan growth is weeks away from turning negative. As such, what “kickstarts” the next spike in the credit impulse is unclear. What is clear is that if the traditional 3-6 month lag between credit inflection points, i.e. impulse, and economic growth is maintained, the global economy is set for a dramatic collapse some time in the second half. There are so many experts that are warning about big economic trouble in our immediate future. I would like to say that all of the experts that are freaking out are wrong, but I can’t do that. I have not seen an atmosphere like this since 2008 and 2009, and everything points to an acceleration of the crisis as we enter the second half of this year.',\n",

       " ('Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression?\\n\\nThe Odds Are Never In Our Favor How would you feel if you went to the store to buy something, and someone rushed ahead of you and purchased it first and then sold it to you at a higher price? Well, in the financial world this happens millions upon millions of times. In fact, this practice has become so popular that it has spawned an entire industry known as “high frequency trading”. At this point, high frequency trading makes up about half of all trading volume on Wall Street, and it is costing the rest of us billions of dollars a year. And the funny thing is that this is all perfectly legal. High frequency trading firms are exploiting a glitch in the system, and by allowing this to go on, the authorities have essentially given them a license to steal from the rest of us. Sadly, this is just another example that shows that the odds are never in our favor. The “little guy” never seems to be able to win, and those at the top of the food chain like it that way. Making money in the stock market is supposed to be about making wise investment decisions. It isn’t supposed to be about finding a glitch in a video game and exploiting it. But that is essentially what these high frequency traders have done. They have spent an extraordinary amount of time and energy figuring out ways to make pennies (or sometimes just fractions of a penny) on the trades that the rest of us make. Fortunately, this practice was exposed in front of the entire world by 60 Minutes the other night. Steve Kroft interviewed a former trader named Michael Lewis that just released a new book entitled “Flash Boys” that is all about the evils of high frequency trading. The following is an excerpt from that interview… Steve Kroft: And this is all being done by computers? Michael Lewis: All being done by computers. It’s too fast to be done by humans. Humans have been completely removed from the marketplace. “Fast” is the operative word. Machines with secret programs are now trading stocks in tiny fractions of a second, way too fast to be seen or recorded on a stock ticker or computer screen. Faster than the market itself. High-frequency traders, big Wall Street firms and stock exchanges have spent billions to gain an advantage of a millisecond for themselves and their customers, just to get a peek at stock market prices and orders a flash before everyone else, along with the opportunity to act on it. Michael Lewis: The insiders are able to move faster than you. They’re able to see your order and play it against other orders in ways that you don’t understand. They’re able to front run your order. Steve Kroft: What do you mean front run? Michael Lewis: Means they’re able to identify your desire to, to buy shares in Microsoft and buy ’em in front of you and sell ’em back to you at a higher price. It all happens in infinitesimally small periods of time. There’s speed advantage that the faster traders have is milliseconds, some of it is fractions of milliseconds. But it”s enough for them to identify what you’re gonna do and do it before you do it at your expense. Steve Kroft: So it drives the price up. Michael Lewis: So it drives the price up, and in turn you pay a higher price. You can watch the entire interview right here. Unlike most mainstream media news reports, this one is actually worth your time. I have watched the entire thing, and I highly recommend it. Of course there have been many that have been screaming about high frequency trading for many years. Zero Hedge is just one example. This practice has gone on year after year and the federal government has looked the other way. These high frequency trading firms do not add anything to society. As Barry Ritholtz noted recently, one of these firms has an average holding period for stocks of just 11 seconds, and at one point it stated that it had “not had a losing day of trading in four years“… The only surprising thing about Lewis’s assertion was that anyone could be even remotely surprised by it. The math on trading is simple: It is a zero-sum game. One trader’s gain is another trader’s loss. Only in the case of HFT, the losers are the investors — by way of their pension funds, retirement accounts and institutional funds. The HFT’s take — the “skim” — comes out of these large institution’s trade executions. The technology behind HFT may be complex, but the math is that simple. Once the Securities and Exchange Commission allowed stock exchanges to share with traders all of the unexecuted incoming orders, it was hard not to make money by skimming a few cents or fractions of a cent from each trade. Several years ago, the founder of Tradebot, one of the biggest high-frequency firms, had said that the firm had “not had a losing day of trading in four years.” The firm’s average holding period for stocks is 11 seconds. How in the world does that kind of behavior add any value to society? They are just skimming money that should be going to others. Billions of dollars is essentially being stolen from pension funds and retirement accounts, and it is time that people started getting outraged about this. Unfortunately, even if this practice is outlawed, the truth is that the odds will still never be in our favor. There are millions of Americans that dream of getting ahead, but they never seem to be able to get there. They work incredibly hard, but the more they earn, the more the government taxes them. If somehow you do manage to scrape together a little bit of money to invest in the financial markets, any profits that you make will be endlessly eroded by fees, commissions and even more taxes. And it is important to remember that in the financial world, the “little guy” is regarded as easy prey by the hungry wolves that are all too eager to find a way to transfer your money into their own pockets. If you don’t know what you are doing, it is all too easy to get absolutely slaughtered. On Wall Street, there are winners and there are losers. Most of the time, “the little guys” end up losing. But at least they could try to have a system that at least has the appearance of fairness. As long as high frequency trading exists, that will never be the case.',\n",

       " ('Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression?\\n\\nThe Trigger Has Been Pulled And The Slaughter Of The Bonds Has Begun What does it look like when a 30 year bull market ends abruptly? What happens when bond yields start doing things that they haven’t done in 50 years? If your answer to those questions involves the word “slaughter”, you are probably on the right track. Right now, bonds are being absolutely slaughtered, and this is only just the beginning. Over the last several years, reckless bond buying by the Federal Reserve has forced yields down to absolutely ridiculous levels. For example, it simply is not rational to lend the U.S. government money at less than 3 percent when the real rate of inflation is somewhere up around 8 to 10 percent. But when he originally announced the quantitative easing program, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said that he intended to force interest rates to go down, and lots of bond investors made a lot of money riding the bubble that Bernanke created. But now that Bernanke has indicated that the bond buying will be coming to an end, investors are going into panic mode and the bond bubble is starting to burst. One hedge fund executive told CNBC that the “feeling you are getting out there is that people are selling first and asking questions later”. And the yield on 10 year U.S. Treasuries just keeps going up. Today it closed at 2.59 percent, and many believe that it is going to go much higher unless the Fed intervenes. If the Fed does not intervene and allows the bubble that it has created to burst, we are going to see unprecedented carnage. Markets tend to fall faster than they rise. And now that Bernanke has triggered a sell-off in bonds, things are moving much faster than just about anyone anticipated… Wall Street never thought it would be this bad. Over the last two months, and particularly over the last two weeks, investors have been exiting their bond investments with unexpected ferocity, moves that continued through Monday. A bond sell-off has been anticipated for years, given the long run of popularity that corporate and government bonds have enjoyed. But most strategists expected that investors would slowly transfer out of bonds, allowing interest rates to slowly drift up. Instead, since the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, recently suggested that the strength of the economic recovery might allow the Fed to slow down its bond-buying program, waves of selling have convulsed the markets. In particular, junk bonds are getting absolutely hammered. Money is flowing out of high risk corporate debt at an astounding pace… The SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond exchange-traded fund has declined 5 percent over the past month, though it rose in Tuesday trading. The fund has seen $2.7 billion in outflows year to date, according to IndexUniverse. Another popular junk ETF, the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond, has seen nearly $2 billion in outflows this year and is off 3.4 percent over the past five days alone. Investors pulled $333 million from high-yield funds last week, according to Lipper. While correlating to the general trend in fixed income, the slowdown in the junk bond business bodes especially troubling signs for investment banks, which have relied on the debt markets for fully one-third of their business this year, the highest percentage in 10 years. The chart posted below comes from the Federal Reserve, and it “represents the effective yield of the BofA Merrill Lynch US High Yield Master II Index, which tracks the performance of US dollar denominated below investment grade rated corporate debt publically issued in the US domestic market.” In other words, it is a measure of the yield on junk bonds. As you can see, the yield on junk bonds sank to ridiculous lows in May, but since then it has been absolutely skyrocketing… So why should the average American care about this? Well, if the era of “cheap money” is over and businesses have to pay more to borrow, that is going to cause economic activity to slow down. There won’t be as many jobs, part-time workers will get less hours, and raises will become more infrequent. Those are just some of the reasons why you should care about this stuff. Municipal bonds are being absolutely crushed right now too. You see, when yields on U.S. government debt rise, they also rise on state and local government debt. In fact, things have been so bad that hundreds of millions of dollars of municipal bond sales have been postponed in recent days… With yields on the U.S. municipal bond market rising, local issuers on Monday postponed another six bond sales, totaling $331 million, that were originally scheduled to price later this week. Since mid-June, on the prospect that the Federal Reserve could change course on its easy monetary policy as the economy improves, the municipal bond market has seen a total of $2.6 billion in sales either canceled or delayed. If borrowing costs for state and local governments rise, they won’t be able to spend as much money, they won’t be able to hire as many workers, they will need to find more revenue (tax increases), and more of them will go bankrupt. And what we are witnessing right now is just the beginning. Things are going to get MUCH worse. The following is what Robert Wenzel recently had to say about the municipal bond market… Thus, there is only one direction for rates: UP, with muni bonds leading the decline, given that the financial structures of many municipalities are teetering. There is absolutely no good reason to be in municipal bonds now. And muni ETFs will be a worse place to be, given this is relatively HOT money that will try to get out of the exit door all at once. But, as I wrote about yesterday, the worst part of the slaughter is going to be when the 441 trillion dollar interest rate derivatives time bomb starts exploding. If bond yields continue to soar, eventually it will take down some very large financial institutions. The following is from a recent article by Bill Holter… Please understand how many of these interest rate derivatives work. When the rates go against you, “margin” must be posted. By “margin” I mean collateral. Collateral must be shifted from the losing institution to the one on the winning side. When the loser “runs out” of collateral…that is when you get a situation similar to MF Global or Lehman Bros., they are forced to shut down and the vultures then come in and pick the bones clean…normally. Now it is no longer “normal,” now a Lehman Bros will take the whole tent down. Most people have no idea how vulnerable our financial system is. It is a house of cards of risk, debt and leverage. Wall Street has become the largest casino in the history of the planet, and the wheels could come off literally at any time. And it certainly does not help that a whole host of cyclical trends appear to be working against us. Posted below is an extended excerpt from a recent article by Taki Tsaklanos and GE Christenson… ********** Charles Nenner Research (source) Stocks should peak in mid-2013 and fall until about 2020. Similarly, bonds should peak in the summer of 2013 and fall thereafter for 20 years. He bases his conclusions entirely on cycle research. He expects the Dow to fall to around 5,000 by 2018 – 2020. Kress Cycles by Clif Droke (source) The major 120 year cycle plus all minor cycles trend down into late 2014. The stock market should decline hard into late 2014. Elliott Wave Cycles by Robert Prechter (source) He believes that the stock market has peaked and has entered a generational bear-market. He anticipates a crash low in the market around 2016 – 2017. Market Energy Wave (source) He sees a 36 year cycle in stock markets that is peaking in mid-2013 and down 2013 – 2016. “… the controlling energy wave is scheduled to flip back to negative on July 19 of this year.” Equity markets should drop 25 – 50%. Armstrong Economics (source) His economic confidence model projects a peak in confidence in August 2013, a bottom in September 2014, and another peak in October 2015. The decline into January 2020 should be severe. He expects a world-wide crash and contraction in economies from 2015 – 2020. Cycles per Charles Hugh Smith (source) He discusses four long-term cycles that bottom roughly in the 2010 – 2020 period. They are: Credit expansion/contraction cycle; Price inflation/wage cycle; Generational cycle; and Peak oil extraction cycle. Harry Dent – Demographics (source) Stock prices should drop, on average for the balance of this decade. Demographic cycles in the United States (and elsewhere) indicate a contraction in real terms for most of this decade. ********** I was stunned when I originally read through that list. Is it just a coincidence that so many researchers have come to such a similar conclusion? The central banks of the world could attempt to “kick the can down the road” by buying up lots and lots of bonds, but it does not appear that is going to happen. The Federal Reserve may not listen to the American people, but there is one institution that the Fed listens to very carefully – the Bank for International Settlements. It is the central bank of central banks, and today 58 global central banks belong to the BIS. Every two months, the central bankers of the world (including Bernanke) gather in Basel, Switzerland for a “Global Economy Meeting”. At those meetings, decisions are made which affect every man, woman and child on the planet. And the BIS has just come out with its annual report. In that annual report, the BIS says that central banks “cannot do more without compounding the risks they have already created”, and that central banks should “encourage needed adjustments” in the financial markets. In other words, the BIS is saying that it is time to end the bond buying… The Basel-based BIS – known as the central bank of central banks – said in its annual report that using current monetary policy employed in the euro zone, the U.K., Japan and the U.S. will not bring about much-needed labor and product market reforms and is a recipe for failure. “Central banks cannot do more without compounding the risks they have already created,” it said in its latest annual report released on Sunday. “[They must] encourage needed adjustments rather than retard them with near-zero interest rates and purchases of ever-larger quantities of government securities.” So expect central banks to start scaling back their intervention in the marketplace. Yes, this is probably going to cause interest rates to rise dramatically and cause all sorts of chaos as the bubble that they created implodes. It could even potentially cause a worse financial crisis than we saw back in 2008. If that happens, the central banks of the world can swoop in and try to save us with their bond buying once again. Isn’t our system wonderful?',\n",

       " ('Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression?\\n\\nWe Just Witnessed The Greatest One Day Global Stock Market Loss In World History More stock market wealth was lost on Friday than on any other day in world history. As you will see below, global investors lost two trillion dollars on the day following the Brexit vote. And remember, this is on top of the trillions that global investors have already lost over the past 12 months. It is important to understand that the Brexit vote was not the beginning of a new crisis – it has simply accelerated a global financial crisis that started last year and that was already in the process of unfolding. As I noted on Friday, we have been waiting for “the next Lehman Brothers moment” that would really unleash fear and panic globally, and now we have it. The next six months should be absolutely fascinating to watch. According to CNBC, the total amount of money lost on global stock markets on Friday surpassed anything that we had ever seen before, and that includes the darkest days of the financial crisis of 2008… Worldwide markets hemorrhaged more than $2 trillion in paper wealth on Friday, according to data from S&P Global, the worst on record. For context, that figure eclipsed the whipsaw trading sessions of the 2008 financial crisis, according to S&P analyst Howard Silverblatt. The prior one day sell-off record was $1.9 trillion back in September of 2008, Silverblatt noted. According to S&P’s Broad Market Index, combined market capitalization is currently worth nearly $42 trillion. And of course many of the wealthiest individuals on the planet got absolutely hammered. According to Bloomberg, the 400 richest people in the world lost a total of $127.4 billion dollars on Friday… The world’s 400 richest people lost $127.4 billion Friday as global equity markets reeled from the news that British voters elected to leave the European Union. The billionaires lost 3.2 percent of their total net worth, bringing the combined sum to $3.9 trillion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The biggest decline belonged to Europe’s richest person, Amancio Ortega, who lost more than $6 billion, while nine others dropped more than $1 billion, including Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, the wealthiest person in the U.K. Could you imagine losing a billion dollars on a single day? I am sure that Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos are not shivering in their boots quite yet, but what if the markets keep on bleeding like they did in 2008? On the other hand, globalist magnate George Soros made a ton of money on Friday because he had positioned himself for a Brexit ahead of time. The following comes from the London Independent… The billionaire who predicted Brexit would bring about “Black Friday” and a crisis for the finances of ordinary people appears to have profited hugely from the UK’s surprise exit from the EU. George Soros is widely known as the man who “broke” the Bank of England in 1992, when he bet against the pound and made a reported £1.5bn. Although the exact amount Mr Soros has gained after Brexit is not known, public filings show he doubled his bets earlier this year that stocks would fall. So what will happen on Monday when the markets reopen? Personally, I don’t think that it will be as bad as Friday. But I could be wrong. In early trading, Dow futures, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures are all down… Dow futures fell by 90 points in early trading, while S&P 500 futures slipped 11 points, and NASDAQ futures dipped 24 points. Gold futures rose, in a reflection of sustained demand for safe-haven assets. And at this moment, the British pound is getting absolutely crushed. It is down to 1.33, and I would expect to see it fall a lot lower in the weeks and months to come. Why? Well, the truth is that now that the British people have voted to leave the EU, the globalists have to make it as painful as possible on them in order to send a warning to other nations that may consider leaving. I think that a recent article by W. Ben Hunt explained this very well… What’s next? From a game theory perspective, the EU and ECB need to crush the UK. It’s like the Greek debt negotiations … it was never about Greece, it was always about sending a signal that dissent and departure will not be tolerated to the countries that matter to the survival of the Eurozone (France, Italy, maybe Spain). Now they (and by “they” I mean the status quo politicians throughout the EU, not just Germany) are going to send that same signal to the same countries by hurting the UK any way they can, creating a Narrative that it’s economic death to leave the EU, much less the Eurozone. It’s not spite. It’s purely rational. It’s the smart move. The elite need a crisis now in order to show everyone that globalism is the answer and not the problem. If the British people were allowed to thrive once they walked away, that would only encourage more countries to go down the exact same path. This is something that the elite are determined to avoid. The Brexit vote has barely sunk in, and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are already projecting a recession for the United Kingdom. Sadly, I believe that this is what we will see happen. But it won’t just be the British that suffer. On Friday, European banking stocks had their worst day ever. In particular, Deutsche Bank fell an astounding 17.49 percent to an all-time record closing low of 14.72. I have warned repeatedly about the implosion of Deutsche Bank, and this crisis could be the catalyst for it. In addition, I have repeatedly warned about the slow-motion meltdown that is happening in Japan. On Friday, Japanese stocks lost 1286 points, and the yen surged in the exact opposite direction that the government is trying to send it… Tokyo, we have a problem. Last week, market tumult stemming from the U.K.’s vote to quit the European Union drove the British pound to its weakest levels in three decades. Yet it also sent investors flocking to traditional safe haven assets like the U.S. dollar, gold and the yen, the latter surging against every major currency as the results of Brexit became clear: Dollar/yen spiked from a Thursday high near 107 to a two-year low near 99. Just like in 2008, there will be days when global markets will be green. When that happens, it will not mean that the crisis is over. If you follow my work closely, then you know that it is imperative to look at the bigger picture. Over the past 12 months, there have been some very nice market rallies around the world, but investors have still lost trillions of dollars overall. What happens on any one particular day is not the story. Rather, the key is to focus on the long-term trends. And without a doubt, this Brexit vote could be “the tipping point” that greatly accelerates our ongoing woes… “Brexit is the biggest global monetary shock since 2008,” said David Beckworth, a scholar at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, in a blog post on Friday. “This could be the tipping point that turns the existing global slowdown of 2016 into a global recession.” We were already dealing with a new global economic crisis without the Brexit vote. But what this does is it introduces an element of panic and fear that had been missing up until this current time. And markets do not like panic and fear very much. In general, markets tend to go up when things are calm and predictable, and they tend to go down when chaos reigns. Unfortunately, I believe that we are going to see quite a bit more chaos for the rest of 2016, and the trillions that were lost on Friday may turn out to be just the tip of the iceberg.',\n",

       " ('Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression?\\n\\nWhat In The World Just Happened To The New York Stock Exchange? Do you believe that the New York Stock Exchange shut down because of a “technical glitch” on Wednesday? At 11:32 AM on Wednesday morning, trading on the New York Stock Exchange was halted due to “internal technical issues”, and it did not resume until 3:10 PM. Officials insist that there is no evidence that a cyberattack caused the technical problems even though hactivists had hinted that something may happen the night before. Adding to the suspicion is the fact that United Airlines and the Wall Street Journal also experienced very serious “technical glitches” on Wednesday. Others found it very curious that trading on the NYSE was halted just after Chinese stocks had absolutely plummeted the night before. In fact, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index experienced the largest one day decline that we have witnessed since November 2008. So is there more going on here than meets the eye? Overall, the Dow was down 261 points on Wednesday, and the Dow and the S&P 500 both closed below their 200 day moving averages. Iron ore had its biggest daily price drop ever, and the price of oil continued to decline. But it was the stunning shut down of the New York Stock Exchange that made headlines all over the world… The New York Stock Exchange, United Airlines and the Wall Street Journal have all fallen victim to a series of massive technical glitches within hours of each other. NYSE halted all trading for ‘technical reasons’ at 11:32am and only reopened at 3:10pm – but says the problem is an internal one and not the result of a cyberattack. It comes as tens of thousands of United Airlines passengers were stranded at U.S. airports on Wednesday morning after all of the carrier’s flights were grounded nationwide due to a computer system glitch. The Wall Street Journal was also left unable to publish after its systems came under attack and has been forced to switch to an alternative site design. In response to the shut down, the following photo began circulating on Twitter… Live shot from the #NYSE server room pic.twitter.com/z0OAfJ6bGI — Zardoz Moot (@Zardoz_Moot) July 8, 2015 But was it really just a “technical glitch”? Of course they probably would never admit it publicly if it was a cyberattack. We live at a time when the authorities are much more concerned with keeping everyone calm than they are about telling us the truth. So in the end all we can really do is speculate about what really happened. But what we do know is that the stock market crash in China got even worse the night before this shutdown. The Shanghai Composite Index and the Hang Seng Index both declined by almost six percent overnight. Overall, the Shanghai Composite Index is now down by more than 30 percent in less than a month, and the Chinese version of the NASDAQ is down by more than 40 percent… In just three weeks, stocks listed on mainland China’s most prominent exchange have fallen by more than 30% from their seven-year highs. The even more speculative ChiNext Index has lost 42% of its value over the 21 days. Government regulators have now banned, for six months, Chinese executives from selling stock in their own companies. This is only one of a number moves made by panicked officials. At this point, trading for approximately 45 percent of all stocks on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges has been suspended. So as a result the selling has bled over to the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong, and this has caused tremendous chaos… Hong Kong’s benchmark stock gauge plunged the most since the global financial crisis as an equity rout in mainland China rippled across Asia. The Hang Seng Index fell 5.8 percent to 23,516.56 at the close today, the biggest drop since November 2008, after slumping as much as 8.6 percent. Even though the Chinese have been trying all sorts of crazy things to stop the crash, nothing has worked. Instead, the selling restrictions have only seemed to fuel the panic even more… “Investors are disappointed and afraid that the Chinese policy makers lost control of the market,” said Mari Oshidari, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Okasan Securities Group Inc. “With no end in sight to the plunge, sentiment has turned cold. With liquidity drying up in the mainland, the Hong Kong market is being sold instead –- the only thing it can do is just quietly take the storm.” Meanwhile, things over in Europe have become more ominous as well. As I wrote about yesterday, EU officials have declared this week to be “the final deadline” for making a deal with Greece. On Wednesday, Greece applied for a new three year emergency loan, and European officials have said that they will consider it… A race to save Greece from bankruptcy and keep it in the euro gathered pace on Wednesday when Athens formally applied for a three-year loan and European authorities launched an accelerated review of the request. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called in a speech to the European Parliament for a fair deal, acknowledging Greece’s historic responsibility for its plight, after EU leaders gave him five days to come up with convincing reforms. The government submitted a request to the European Stability Mechanism bailout fund to lend an unspecified amount “to meet Greece’s debt obligations and to ensure stability of the financial system”. It promised to begin implementing tax and pension measures sought by creditors as early as Monday. But there is still a tremendous amount of skepticism about whether a deal can be reached. The Greeks want debt relief, but the Germans have completely ruled out any sort of a debt haircut. Most of the rest of the EU nations are siding with the Germans, and unless the Greek government caves in at the last moment it appears that a “Grexit” is quite likely. For most people, the events of 2008 have long since faded from their memories. After years of soaring stock prices, many in the financial world have become extremely comfortable. But as we are seeing in China, what goes up must eventually come down. And the shut down of the New York Stock Exchange today should be a huge wake up call for all of us. We have become extraordinarily dependent on computers and technology, and this makes us exceedingly vulnerable. Someday, we might just experience a cyberattack that causes a tremendous amount of permanent damage that cannot be undone. What will we do then? Our world is becoming increasingly unstable, and events are beginning to accelerate as we enter the second half of 2015. So what comes next?

       " ('Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression?\\n\\nWhen The Derivatives Market Crashes (And It Will) U.S. Taxpayers Will Be On The Hook Warren Buffett once said that derivatives are “financial weapons of mass destruction”, and that statement is more true today than it ever has been before. Recently, JP Morgan made national headlines when it announced that it was going to take a 2 billion dollar loss from derivatives trades gone bad. Well, it turns out that JP Morgan did not tell us the whole truth. As you will see later in this article, most analysts are estimating that the losses will eventually be far larger than 2 billion dollars. But no matter how bad things get for JP Morgan, it will not be allowed to fail. JP Morgan is the largest bank in the United States, so it is essentially the “granddaddy” of the too big to fail banks. If JP Morgan gets to the point where it is about to collapse, the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve will rush in to save it. Because of this “security blanket”, banks such as JP Morgan feel free to take outrageous risks. Today, JP Morgan has more exposure to derivatives than anyone else in the world. If they win, they win big. If they lose, U.S. taxpayers will be on the hook. Not only that, but thanks to Dodd-Frank, U.S. taxpayers are on the hook for bailing out the major derivatives clearinghouses if there is ever a major derivatives crisis. So when the derivatives market crashes (and it will) you and I will be left holding a gigantic bill. Derivatives almost caused the complete collapse of insurance giant AIG back in 2008. But instead of learning our lessons, the derivatives bubble has gotten even larger since that time. A Bloomberg article that was published last year contained a great quote from Mark Mobius about derivatives…. Mark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Asset Management’s emerging markets group, said another financial crisis is inevitable because the causes of the previous one haven’t been resolved. “There is definitely going to be another financial crisis around the corner because we haven’t solved any of the things that caused the previous crisis,” Mobius said at the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Japan in Tokyo today in response to a question about price swings. “Are the derivatives regulated? No. Are you still getting growth in derivatives? Yes.” Never in the history of the world have we ever seen anything like this derivatives bubble. But instead of getting it under control, we just allowed it to get bigger and bigger and bigger. Now JP Morgan is in quite a bit of trouble. A recent Daily Finance article summarized how JP Morgan got into this mess…. Bruno Iksil, a trader working in the bank’s London office, placed a massive bet in the derivatives market. Derivatives “derive” their value from the value of an underlying asset, like stocks, bonds, currencies, or a market index. The specific type of derivative used in Iksil’s bet was a credit default swap index, known as “CDX.NA.IG.9.” CDX.NA.IG.9 tracks a basket of corporate bonds. Iksil’s positions on the index were so big (one report put it at $100 billion) that they were moving the market and interfering with other traders’ positions. These annoyed traders — hedge-fund managers — dubbed Iksil “the London Whale” for his outsize bets. So if the real number isn’t 2 billion dollars, how much will JP Morgan eventually lose? Morgan Stanley says that the losses could eventually reach 5 billion dollars. The Independent is reporting that the losses could eventually reach 7 billion dollars. One author featured on Zero Hedge suggested that the losses could ultimately reach 20 billion dollars…. Simple: because it knew with 100% certainty that if things turn out very, very badly, that the taxpayer, via the Fed, would come to its rescue. Luckily, things turned out only 80% bad. Although it is not over yet: if credit spreads soar, assuming at $200 million DV01, and a 100 bps move, JPM could suffer a $20 billion loss when all is said and done. But hey: at least “net” is not “gross” and we know, just know, that the SEC will get involved and make sure something like this never happens again. The truth is that nobody really knows. Everybody agrees that the losses will likely far exceed 2 billion dollars, but the real extent of the crisis will not be known until the trades play out. According to the Huffington Post, JP Morgan recently sold 25 billion dollars of profitable securities to raise some cash. The profit on the sale of those securities will be somewhere in the neighborhood of a billion dollars. A billion dollars will help, but it will not be nearly enough. Many are interpreting this move as a sign of panic by JP Morgan. Meanwhile, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon continues to do quite well. In fact, his 23 million dollar pay package was recently approved by shareholders at an annual meeting. Wouldn’t you like to do your job badly and still make 23 million dollars? Right now, JP Morgan is essentially in a “staring contest” with those on the other side of the derivatives trades that went bad. This “staring contest” was described in a recent CNN article…. It’s clear from public data filed with The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation that JPMorgan Chase hasn’t sold any of its positions yet. The DTCC tracks trading activity and sizes of positions on the IG9 and other indexes, and there haven’t been any big moves since last week. “Whatever the size was, it’s clearly not something that you can call one or two dealers and sell,” said Garth Friesen, a co-chief investment officer at AVM, a derivatives hedge fund that’s not involved in these trades. As soon as it becomes clear that JPMorgan Chase is unwinding its position, it will be obvious to players on every major trading desk. Hedge funds will immediately start piling into that index and buying protection, driving up the bank’s losses. Until then, it won’t cost the hedge funds much to sit and wait. JP Morgan is desperately hoping that the markets move in their favor. If the markets move against JP Morgan in a big way it could potentially be absolutely catastrophic for the biggest bank in America. An excerpt from an email that Steve Quayle recently received from an anonymous international banking source contained some chilling analysis of the situation…. The derivative market that JPM plays in is the CDX.NA.IG.9, when factions within their London office (London Whale) made overly leveraged swaps, hedge funds smelled blood and so did a few banks. You see any moves that JPM does here on out exposes their weakness further. Which they can not afford any more exposure thus they are not buying back any more shares which is the equivalent of cutting an artery in a pool full of sharks. The strategy they are taking right now is to sit through the storm and ride it out as they can do nothing else for any action will make them even more vulnerable. They can not absorb hits in both JPM SLV and CDX.NA.IG.9. Inactivity is not something they want to do it is something they have to do. There is no other choice for them. So what will happen if JP Morgan loses too much money? Well, it will beg the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve for money and the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve will comply. There is no way that they are going to let the largest bank in America fail. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, Dodd-Frank has put U.S. taxpayers on the hook for future bailouts of derivatives clearinghouses. This was detailed in a recent Wall Street Journal article…. Little noticed is that on Tuesday Team Obama took its first formal steps toward putting taxpayers behind Wall Street derivatives trading — not behind banks that might make mistakes in derivatives markets, but behind the trading itself. Yes, the same crew that rails against the dangers of derivatives is quietly positioning these financial instruments directly above the taxpayer safety net. One of the things that Dodd-Frank does is that it gives the Federal Reserve the power to provide “discount and borrowing privileges” to derivatives clearinghouses in the event of a major derivatives crisis. This is what our politicians love to do. They love to have the U.S. taxpayer guarantee everything. Our politicians look at us as one giant insurance policy. Apparently they believe that if anything in the financial world goes wrong that U.S. taxpayers should be the ones to clean up the mess. But will we really have enough money to bail everyone out when the derivatives market crashes? Today, the 9 largest banks in the United States have a total of more than 200 trillion dollars of exposure to derivatives. That is approximately 3 times the size of the entire global economy. The U.S. government is already nearly 16 trillion dollars in debt. How in the world can we afford to keep bailing out the huge messes that Wall Street makes? Sadly, most Americans have no idea how vulnerable our financial system really is. It is a poorly constructed house of cards that could come crashing down at any time. If you still have faith in our financial system you are being quite foolish and you will soon be bitterly, bitterly disappointed.',\n",

       " ('Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression?\\n\\nWhy Is The Smart Money Suddenly Getting Out Of Stocks And Real Estate? If wonderful times are ahead for U.S. financial markets, then why is so much of the smart money heading for the exits? Does it make sense for insiders to be getting out of stocks and real estate if prices are just going to continue to go up? The Dow is up about 17 percent so far this year, and it just keeps setting new record high after new record high. U.S. home prices have risen about 11 percent from a year ago, and some analysts are projecting that we are on the verge of a brand new housing boom. Why would the smart money want to leave the party when it is just getting started? Well, of course the truth is that the “smart money” is regarded as being smart because they usually make better decisions than other people do. And right now the smart money is screaming that it is time to get out of the markets. For example, the SentimenTrader Smart/Dumb Money Index is now the lowest that it has been in more than two years. The smart money is busy selling even as the dumb money is busy buying. So precisely what does the smart money expect to happen? Are they anticipating a market “correction” or something bigger than that? Those are very good questions. Unfortunately, the smart money rarely divulges their secrets, so we can only watch what they do. And right now a lot of insiders are making some very interesting moves. For example, George Soros has been dumping almost all of his financial stocks. The following is from a recent article by Becket Adams… Everyone’s favorite billionaire investor is back in the spotlight, and this time he has a few people wondering what he’s up to. George Soros has dumped his position with several major banks including JPMorgan Chase, Capitol One, SunTrust, and Morgan Stanley. He has reduced his exposure to Citigroup and decreased his stake in AIG by two-thirds. In fact, Soros’ financial stock holdings are down by roughly 80 percent, a massive drop from his position just three months ago, according to SNL Financial. So exactly what is going on? Why is Soros doing this? Well, there is certainly a lot to criticize when it comes to Soros, but you can’t really blame him if he is just taking his profits and running. Financial stocks have been on a tremendous run and that run is going to end at some point. Smart investors lock in their profits while they still can. And without a doubt, stocks have become completely divorced from economic reality in recent months. For example, there is usually a very close relationship between corporate earnings and stock prices. But as CNBC recently reported, that relationship has totally broken down lately… That trend disrupted a formerly symbiotic relationship between earnings and stock prices and is indicating that the bluechip average is in for a substantial pullback, according to Tom Kee, who runs the StockTradersDaily investor web site. “They’ve been moving in tandem since 2009, until recently. Earnings per share for the Dow Jones industrial average have flatlined and the price has taken off,” Kee said. “There is something happening here that defines a bubble.” At some point there will be a correction. If the relationship between earnings and stock prices was where it should be, the Dow would be around 13,500 right now. That would be a fall of nearly 2,000 points from where it is at the moment. And we appear to be entering a time when revenues at many corporate giants are actually declining. As I noted in a previous article, corporate revenues are falling at Wal-Mart, Proctor and Gamble, Starbucks, AT&T, Safeway, American Express and IBM. Of course a stock market “correction” can turn into a crash very easily. Financial markets in Japan are already crashing, and many fear that the escalating problems in the third largest economy on the planet will soon spill over into Europe and North America. And things in Europe just continue to get steadily worse. In fact, the New York Times is reporting that the European Central Bank is warning that the risk of a “renewed banking crisis” in Europe is rising… The European Central Bank warned on Wednesday that the euro zone’s slumping economy and a surge in problem loans were raising the risk of a renewed banking crisis, even as overall stress in the region’s financial markets had receded. In a sober assessment of the state of the zone’s financial system, the E.C.B. said that a prolonged recession had made it harder for many borrowers to repay their loans, burdening banks that had still not finished repairing the damage caused by the 2008 financial crisis. And there are many financial analysts out there that are warning that their cyclical indicators have peaked and that we are on the verge of a fresh global downturn… “We see building evidence of a cyclical downturn,” said Fredrik Nerbrand, HSBC’s global asset guru. “We find it highly troubling that the eurozone is still marred in a recession at the same time as our cyclical indicators appear to have peaked.” In the United States, a lot of the smart money has also decided that it is time to bail out of the housing market before this latest housing bubble bursts. The following is one example of this phenomenon that was discussed in a recent Businessweek article… Hedge fund manager Bruce Rose was among the first investors to coax institutional money into the mom and pop business of single-family home rentals, raising $450 million last year from Oaktree Capital Group LLC.\\n\\nNow, with house prices climbing at the fastest pace in seven years and investors swamping the rental market, Rose says it no longer makes sense to be a buyer. “We just don’t see the returns there that are adequate to incentivize us to continue to invest,” Rose, 55, chief executive officer of Carrington Holding Co. LLC, said in an interview at his Aliso Viejo, California office. “There’s a lot of — bluntly — stupid money that jumped into the trade without any infrastructure, without any real capabilities and a kind of build-it-as-you-go mentality that we think is somewhat irresponsible.” So what does all of this mean? Is there a reason why the smart money is suddenly getting out of stocks and real estate? It could just be that the insiders are simply responding to market dynamics and that many of them are just seeking to lock in their profits. Or it could be something much more than that. What do you think? Why are so many insiders heading for the exits right now? Feel free to post a comment with your thoughts below…',\n",

       " ('Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression?\\n\\nWhy The Damage To The Economy Caused By The Oil Crash Is Going To Get Progressively Worse We are really starting to see the price of oil weigh very heavily on the economy and on the stock market. On Tuesday, the Dow was down 291 points, and the primary reason for the decline was disappointing corporate sales numbers. For example, heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar is blaming the “dramatic decline in the price of oil” for much lower than anticipated sales during the fourth quarter of 2014. Even though Caterpillar is not an “energy company”, the price of oil is critical to their success. And the same could be said about thousands of other companies. That is why I have repeatedly stated that anyone who believes that collapsing oil prices are good for the U.S. economy is crazy. The key to how much damage this oil collapse is going to do to our economy is not how low prices ultimately go. Rather, the key is how long they stay at these low levels. If the price of oil went back to $80 a barrel next week, the damage would be fairly minimal. But if the price of oil stays at this current level for the remainder of 2015, the damage will be absolutely catastrophic. Just think of the price of oil like a hot iron. If you touch it for just a fraction of a second, it won’t do too much damage. But if you press it against your skin for an hour, you will be severely damaged for the rest of your life at the very least. So the damage that we are witnessing right now is just the very beginning unless the price of oil goes back up substantially. When the price of oil first started crashing, most analysts focused on the impact that it would have on energy companies. And without a doubt, quite a few of them are likely to be wiped out if things don’t change soon. But of even greater importance is the ripple effects that the price of oil will have throughout our entire economy. The oil price crash is not that many months old at this point, and yet big companies are already blaming it for causing significant problems. The following is how Caterpillar explained their disappointing sales numbers on Tuesday… “The recent dramatic decline in the price of oil is the most significant reason for the year-over-year decline in our sales and revenues outlook. Current oil prices are a significant headwind for Energy & Transportation and negative for our construction business in the oil producing regions of the world. In addition, with lower prices for copper, coal and iron ore, we’ve reduced our expectations for sales of mining equipment. We’ve also lowered our expectations for construction equipment sales in China. While our market position in China has improved, 2015 expectations for the construction industry in China are lower” We also learned on Tuesday that orders for durable goods were extremely disappointing. Many analysts believe that this is another area where the oil price crash is having an impact… Orders for business equipment unexpectedly fell in December for a fourth month, signaling a global growth slowdown is weighing on American companies. Bookings for non-military capital goods excluding aircraft dropped 0.6 percent for a second month, data from the Commerce Department showed. Demand for all durable goods − items meant to last at least three years − declined 3.4 percent, the worst performance since August. Let’s keep an eye on the durable goods numbers in coming months. Usually, when the economy is heading into a recession durable goods numbers start declining. Meanwhile, a bunch of other big companies reported disappointing sales numbers on Tuesday as well. The following summary comes from the Crux… Microsoft lost 9.9 percent as software-license sales to businesses were below forecasts. Caterpillar plunged 7.3 percent after forecasting 2015 results that trailed estimates as plunging oil prices signal lower demand from energy companies. DuPont Co. dropped 2.8 percent as a stronger dollar cuts into the chemical maker’s profit. Procter & Gamble Co. and United Technologies Corp. declined at least 2 percent after saying the surging greenback will lower full-year earnings. What the economy could really use right now is a huge rebound in the price of oil. Unfortunately, as I wrote about the other day, that is not likely to happen any time soon. In fact, a top executive for Goldman Sachs recently told CNBC that he believes that the price of oil could ultimately go as low as 30 dollars a barrel. And hedge fund managers are backing up their belief that oil is heading even lower with big money… Hedge funds boosted bearish wagers on oil to a four-year high as US supplies grew the most since 2001. Money managers increased short positions in West Texas Intermediate crude to the highest level since September 2010 in the week ended January 20, US Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. Net-long positions slipped for the first time in three weeks. US crude supplies rose by 10.1 million barrels to 397.9 million in the week ended January 16 and the country will pump the most oil since 1972 this year, the Energy Information Administration says. Saudi Arabia’s King Salman, the new ruler of the world’s biggest oil exporter, said he will maintain the production policy of his predecessor despite a 58 percent drop in prices since June. Sadly, the truth is that anyone that thought that the stock market would go up forever and that the U.S. economy would be able to avoid a major downturn indefinitely was just being delusional. Our economy goes through cycles, and every financial bubble eventually bursts. For example, did you know that the S&P 500 has never had seven up years in a row? The following comes from a CNBC article that was posted on Tuesday… Doubleline Capital founder Jeff Gundlach, more known for his bond prowess than as an equity market expert, pointed out that the S&P 500 has never had seven consecutive up years. Of course, records are made to be broken, and each year is supposed to stand on its own. But in a market that faces an uncertain future regarding monetary policy, the specter of a global economic slowdown, and an oil price plunge that is dampening capital investment, Gundlach’s little factoid sparked a lot of chatter at ETF.com’s InsideETFs conference in Hollywood, Florida. Hmm – that reminds me of the seven year cycles that I discussed in my article yesterday. If the price of oil stays this low for the rest of 2015, there is no way that we are going to avoid a recession. If the price of oil stays this low for the rest of 2015, there is no way that we are going to avoid a stock market crash. So let’s hope that the price of oil starts going back up. If it doesn’t, the damage that is inflicted on our economy is going to get progressively worse.',\n",

       " ('Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression?\\n\\nWill Italy Be The Spark That Sets Off Financial Armageddon In Europe? Is the financial collapse of Italy going to be the final blow that breaks the back of Europe financially? Most people don’t realize this, but Italy is actually the third largest debtor in the entire world after the United States and Japan. Italy currently has a debt to GDP ratio of more than 120 percent, and Italy has a bigger national debt than anyone else in Europe does. That is why it is such a big deal that Italian voters have just overwhelmingly rejected austerity. The political parties led by anti-austerity candidates Silvio Berlusconi and Beppe Grillo did far better than anticipated. When you combine their totals, they got more than 50 percent of the vote. Italian voters have seen what austerity has done to Greece and Spain and they want no part of it. Unfortunately for Italian voters, it has been the promise of austerity that has kept the Italian financial system stable in recent months. Now that Italian voters have clearly rejected austerity, investors are fearing that austerity programs all over Europe may start falling apart. This is creating quite a bit of panic in European financial markets right now. On Tuesday, Italian stocks had their worst day in 10 months, Italian bond yields rose by the most that we have seen in 19 months, and the stocks of the two largest banks in Italy both fell by more than 8 percent. Italy is already experiencing its fourth recession since 2001, and unemployment has been steadily rising. If Italy is now “ungovernable”, as many are saying, then what does that mean for the future of Italy? Will Italy be the spark that sets off financial armageddon in Europe? All of Europe was totally shocked by the election results in Italy. As you can see from the following excerpt from a Bloomberg article, the vote was very divided and the anti-austerity parties did much better than had been projected… The results showed pre-election favorite Pier Luigi Bersani won the lower house with 29.5 percent, less than a half a percentage point ahead of Silvio Berlusconi, the ex-premier fighting a tax-fraud conviction. Beppe Grillo, a former comedian, got 25.6 percent, while Monti scored 10.6 percent. Bersani and his allies got 31.6 percent of votes in the Senate, compared with 30.7 percent for Berlusconi and 23.79 percent for Grillo, according to final figures from the Interior Ministry. So what do those election results mean for Italy and for the rest of Europe? Right now, there is a lot of panic about those results. There is fear that what just happened in Italy could result in a rejection of austerity all over Europe… “I think the election results (or lack thereof) are a negative for the euro, which will likely keep the currency pressured for some time,” Omer Esiner, chief market analyst for Commonwealth Foreign Exchange, told me. But it’s not just the political uncertainty in Italy, he adds. “The shocking gains made by anti-establishment parties in Italy signal a broad-based frustration with austerity among voters and a decisive rejection of the policies pushed by Germany in nations across the euro zone’s periphery. That theme revives unresolved debt crisis issues and could threaten the continuity of reforms across other countries in the euro zone.” And the financial markets have clearly interpreted the election results in Europe as a very bad sign. Zero Hedge summarized some of the bad news out of Europe that we saw on Tuesday… Swiss 2Y rates turned negative once again for the first time in a month; EURUSD relatively flatlined around 1.3050 (250 pips lower than pre-Italy); Europe’s VIX exploded to almost 26% (from under 19% yesterday); and 3-month EUR-USD basis swaps plunged to their most liquidity-demanding level since 12/28. Spain and Italy (and Portugal) were the most hurt in bonds today as 2Y Italian spreads broke back above 200bps (surging over 50bps casting doubt on OMT support) and 3Y Spain yields broke above 3% once again. The Italian equity market suffered its equal biggest drop in 6 months falling back to 10 week lows (and down 14% from its end-Jan highs). Italian bond yields (and spreads) smashed higher – the biggest jump in 19 months as BTP futures volume exploded in the last two days. Not that things in Europe were going well before all this. In fact, the UK was just stripped of its prized AAA credit rating. That was huge news. And check out some of the other things that have been going on in the rest of Europe… In Spain, a major real estate company, Reyal Urbis, collapsed last week, leaving already battered banks on the hook for millions of euros in losses. Meanwhile, the government faces a corruption scandal and a steady stream of anti-austerity demonstrations. Thousands of people took to the streets again on Saturday, protesting deep cuts to health and other services, as well as hefty bank bailouts. Life is no better in a large swath of the broader EU. In Britain, Moody’s cited the continuing economic weakness and the resulting risks to the government’s tight fiscal policy for its rating cut. In Bulgaria, where the government fell last week and the economy is in a shambles, rightists who joined mass demonstrations across the country burned a European Union flag and waved anti-EU banners. Other austerity-minded governments in the EU face similar murky political futures. At this point, Europe is a complete and total economic mess and things are rapidly getting worse. And that is really bad news because Europe is already in the midst of a recession. In fact, according to the BBC, the recession in the eurozone got even deeper during the fourth quarter of 2012… The eurozone recession deepened in the final three months of 2012, official figures show. The economy of the 17 nations in the euro shrank by 0.6% in the fourth quarter, which was worse than forecast. It is the sharpest contraction since the beginning of 2009 and marks the first time the region failed to grow in any quarter during a calendar year. But this is just the beginning. The truth is that government debt is not even the greatest danger that Europe is facing. In reality, a collapse of the European banking system is of much greater concern. Why is that? Well, how would you feel if you woke up someday and every penny that you had in the bank was gone? In the U.S. we don’t have to worry about that so much because all deposits are insured by the FDIC, but in many European countries things work much differently. For example, just check out what Graham Summers recently had to say about the banking system in Spain… It’s a little known fact about the Spanish crisis is that when the Spanish Government merges troubled banks, it typically swaps out depositors’ savings for shares in the new bank. So… when the newly formed bank goes bust, “poof” your savings are GONE. Not gone as in some Spanish version of the FDIC will eventually get you your money, but gone as in gone forever (see the above article for proof). This is why Bankia’s collapse is so significant: in one move, former depositors at seven banks just lost virtually everything. And this in a nutshell is Europe’s financial system today: a totally insolvent sewer of garbage debt, run by corrupt career politicians who have no clue how to fix it or their economies… and which results in a big fat ZERO for those who are nuts enough to invest in it. Be warned. There are many many more Bankias coming to light in the coming months. So if you have not already taken steps to prepare for systemic failure, you NEED to do so NOW. We’re literally at most a few months, and very likely just a few weeks from Europe’s banks imploding, potentially taking down the financial system with them. Think I’m joking? The Fed is pumping hundreds of BILLIONS of dollars into EU banks right now trying to stop this from happening. Like Graham Summers, I am extremely concerned about the European banking system. Europe actually has a much larger banking system than the U.S. does, and if the European banking system implodes that is going to send huge shockwaves to the farthest corners of the globe. But if you want to believe that the “experts” in Europe and in the United States have “everything under control”, then you might as well stop reading now. After all, they are very highly educated and they know what they are doing, right? But if you want to listen to some common sense, you might want to check out this very ominous warning from Karl Denninger… I hope you’re ready. Congress has wasted the time it was given by the Europeans getting things “temporarily” under control. But they didn’t actually get anything under control, as the Italian elections just showed. Now, with the budget over there at risk of being abandoned, and fiscal restraint being abandoned (note: exactly what the US has been doing) the markets are recognizing exactly the risk that never in fact went away over the last couple of years. It was hidden by lies, just as it has been hidden by lies here. Bernanke’s machinations and other games “gave” the Congress four years to do the right thing. They didn’t, because that same “gift” also destroyed all market signals of urgency. As such you have people like Krugman and others claiming that it’s all ok and that we can spend with wild abandon, taking our fiscal medicine never. They were wrong. Congress was wrong. The Republicans were wrong, the Democrats were wrong, and the Administration was wrong. Congress is out of time; as I noted the deficit spending must stop now, irrespective of the fact that it will cause significant economic damage. For the past couple of years, authorities in the U.S. and in Europe have been trying to delay the coming crisis by kicking the can down the road. By doing so, they have been making the eventual collapse even worse. And now time is running out. I hope that you are ready.',\n",

       " ('Are we in love with how smart we are? In America today, there are technology companies that have a much larger “cult following” than any religious organization. And there are millions upon millions of Americans that freely confess that they “believe in science”. So what does this say about us? Does it say that we have discarded ancient “superstitions” and instead have embraced logic and reason? Sadly, in most cases the truth is that we have simply traded one form of religion for another. Scientists and technology gurus have become our new high priests, and most of us blindly follow whatever they tell us. But in the end, just like with so many religious organizations, it is all about the money. Those with the money determine what the science is going to say, who the high priests are going to be, and what messages are conveyed to the public. For example, once upon a time the big tobacco companies had armies of doctors and scientists that swore up and down that smoking cigarettes was not harmful. In fact, many doctors and dentists in America once personally endorsed specific brands of cigarettes. Of course millions of Americans were getting sick and dying, but this was dismissed as “anecdotal evidence”. And over in Germany, “science” was once used to prove that the Germans were the master race. We look back in horror now, but at the time the best “science” in the world was used as justification to promote some horrible untruths. And of course the same thing is happening today. We are told over and over that “the science is settled” regarding genetically-modified food, climate change and vaccine safety, and yet those of us that think for ourselves know that isn’t the case at all. But if you do not believe in the “official story”, you don’t get to be part of the “scientific establishment”.

       " ('Are we on the verge of an unprecedented global currency crisis? On Tuesday, the euro briefly fell below $1.07 for the first time in almost a dozen years. And the U.S. dollar continues to surge against almost every other major global currency. The U.S. dollar index has now risen an astounding 23 percent in just the last eight months. That is the fastest pace that the U.S. dollar has risen since 1981. You might be tempted to think that a stronger U.S. dollar is good news, but it isn’t. A strong U.S. dollar hurts U.S. exports, thus harming our economy. In addition, a weak U.S. dollar has fueled tremendous expansion in emerging markets around the planet over the past decade or so. When the dollar becomes a lot stronger, it becomes much more difficult for those countries to borrow more money and repay old debts. In other words, the emerging market “boom” is about to become a bust. Not only that, it is important to keep in mind that global financial institutions bet a tremendous amount of money on currency movements. According to the Bank for International Settlements, 74 trillion dollars in derivatives are tied to the value of the U.S. dollar, the value of the euro and the value of other global currencies. When currency rates start flying around all over the place, you can rest assured that someone out there is losing an enormous amount of money. If this derivatives bubble ends up imploding, there won’t be enough money in the entire world to bail everyone out.\\n\\nDo you remember what happened the last time the U.S. dollar went on a great run like this?\\n\\nAs you can see from the chart below, it was in mid-2008, and what followed was the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression…\\n\\nA rapidly rising U.S. dollar is extremely deflationary for the overall global economy.\\n\\nThis is a huge red flag, and yet hardly anyone is talking about it.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the euro continues to spiral into oblivion…\\n\\nHow many times have I said it? The euro is heading to all-time lows. It is going to go to parity with the U.S. dollar, and then it is eventually going to go below parity.\\n\\nThis is going to cause massive headaches in the financial world.\\n\\nThe Europeans are attempting to cure their economic problems by creating tremendous amounts of new money. It is the European version of quantitative easing, but it is having some very nasty side effects.\\n\\nThe markets are starting to realize that if the value of the U.S. dollar continues to surge, it is ultimately going to be very bad for stocks. In fact, the strength of the U.S. dollar is being cited as the primary reason for the Dow’s 332 point decline on Tuesday…\\n\\nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 300 points to below the index’s 50-day moving average, wiping out gains for the year. The S&P 500 also closed in the red for the year and breached its 50-day moving average, which is an indicator of the market trend. Only the Nasdaq held onto gains of 2.61 percent for the year. There’s “concern that energy and the strength in the dollar will somehow be negative for the equities,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. He noted that the speed of the dollar’s surge was the greatest market driver, amid mixed economic data and concerns about the Federal Reserve raising interest rates.\\n\\nAnd as I noted above, when the U.S. dollar rises the things that we export to other nations become more expensive and that hurts our businesses.\\n\\nThis is so basic that even the White House understands it…\\n\\nDespite reassurance from The Fed that a strengthening dollar is positive for US jobs, The White House has now issued a statement that a “strengthening USD is a headwind for US growth.”\\n\\nBut even more important, a surging U.S. dollar makes it more difficult for emerging markets all over the world to borrow new money and to repay old debts. This is especially true for nations that heavily rely on exporting commodities…\\n\\nIt becomes especially ugly for emerging market economies that produce commodities. Many emerging market countries rely on their natural resources for growth and haven’t yet developed more advanced industries. As the products of their principal industries decline in value, foreign investors remove available credit while their currency is declining against the U.S. dollar. They don’t just find it difficult to pay their debt – it is impossible.\\n\\nIt has been estimated that emerging markets have borrowed more than 3 trillion dollars since the last financial crisis.\\n\\nBut now the process that created the emerging markets “boom” is starting to go into reverse.\\n\\nThe global economy is fueled by cheap dollars. So if the U.S. dollar continues to rise, that is not going to be good news for anyone.\\n\\nAnd of course the biggest potential threat of all is the 74 trillion dollar currency derivatives bubble which could end up bursting at any time.\\n\\nThe sophisticated computer algorithms that financial institutions use to trade currency derivatives are ultimately based on human assumptions. When currencies move very little and the waters are calm in global financial markets, those algorithms tend to work really, really well.\\n\\nBut when the unexpected happens, some of the largest financial firms in the world can implode seemingly overnight.\\n\\nJust remember what happened to Lehman Brothers back in 2008. Unexpected events can cripple financial giants in just a matter of hours.\\n\\nToday, there are five U.S. banks that each have more than 40 trillion dollars of total exposure to derivatives of all types. Those five banks are JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Citibank and Morgan Stanley.\\n\\nBy transforming Wall Street into a gigantic casino, those banks have been able to make enormous amounts of money.\\n\\nBut they are constantly performing a high wire act. One of these days, their reckless gambling is going to come back to haunt them, and the entire global financial system is going to be severely harmed as a result.\\n\\nAs I have said so many times before, derivatives are going to be at the heart of the next great global financial crisis.\\n\\nAnd thanks to the wild movement of global currencies in recent months, there are now more than 74 trillion dollars in currency derivatives at risk.\\n\\nAnyone that cannot see trouble on the horizon at this point is being willingly blind.',\n",

       " ('Are we right on the verge of one of the greatest financial collapses in American history? I have been repeatedly warning that our ridiculously over-inflated stock market bubble could burst at any time, but former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan believes that the bond bubble actually presents an even greater danger. When you look at the long-term charts, you will see that an epic bond bubble has been growing since the early 1980s, and when it finally collapses the financial carnage is going to be unlike anything we have ever seen before.\\n\\nSince the last financial crisis, global central banks have purchased trillions of dollars worth of bonds, and this has pushed interest rates to absurdly low levels. But of course this state of affairs cannot go on indefinitely, and Greenspan is extremely concerned about what will happen when interest rates start going in the other direction…\\n\\nFormer Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan issued a bold warning Friday that the bond market is on the cusp of a collapse that also will threaten stock prices. In a CNBC interview, the longtime central bank chief said the prolonged period of low interest rates is about to end and, with it, a bull market in fixed income that has lasted more than three decades. “The current level of interest rates is abnormally low and there’s only one direction in which they can go, and when they start they will be rather rapid,” Greenspan said on “Squawk Box.”\\n\\nAnd of course Greenspan is far from alone. In recent months there have been a whole host of prominent voices warning about the devastation that will take place when the bond market begins to shift. For example, the following comes from Nasdaq.com…\\n\\nAdvisors and investors beware, the long-swelling bubble in the bond market looks set to pop. Major bond investors are as worried as they have ever been, mostly because of the reduction in easing that is finally coming to markets. Central banks are letting off the gas pedal for the first time in almost a decade, which could have a devastating effect on the bond market. According to the head of fixed income at JP Morgan Asset Management, who oversees almost half a trillion in AUM, “The next 18 months are going to be incredibly challenging. I am not an equity investor, but I can just imagine how equity investors felt in 1999, during the dotcom bubble”. He continued, “Right now, central banks are printing money at a rate of around $1.5tn per year. That is a lot of money going into bonds. By this time next year, we think this will turn negative”.\\n\\nSo how will we know when a crisis is imminent?\\n\\nSome analysts are telling us to watch the 30-year yield. When it finally moves above its “mega moving average” and stays there, that will be a major red flag…\\n\\nIt’s still too soon to tell, but this could be the beginning of a realignment with both rates getting in sync again. This will not be confirmed, however, until the 30-year yield rises and stays above its mega moving average, currently at 3.18%. As you know, this moving average is super important. It’s identified and confirmed the mega downtrend in long-term interest rates ever since the 1980s. In other words, it doesn’t change often. So, if this trend were to change and turn up, it would be a huge deal.\\n\\nToday, the 30-year yield moved up to 2.83 percent, and so we aren’t too far away.\\n\\nThere are so many prominent voices that are warning of imminent financial disaster, but there are others that believe that we have absolutely nothing to be concerned about. In fact, Jim Paulsen just told CNBC that he believes that this current bull market “could continue to forever”…\\n\\nThe stock market “has an awful good gig going,” with the economic recovery reaching all corners of the globe and U.S. inflation and interest rates still at historic lows, Leuthold Chief Investment Strategist Jim Paulsen told CNBC on Friday. “We’ve got a fully employed economy, rising real wages. We restarted the corporate earnings cycle. We’ve got strong confidence among business and consumers,” he said on “Squawk Box.” “The kick is we can do all of this without aggravating inflation and interest rates,” he said. “If that’s going to continue, I think the bull market could continue to forever.”\\n\\nI think that Paulsen will end up deeply regretting those words.\\n\\nNo bull market lasts forever, and analysts at Goldman Sachs are warning that there is a 99 percent chance that stock market returns will be sub-optimal over the next decade.\\n\\nBut most people believe what they want to believe no matter what the facts may say, and Paulsen apparently wants to believe that things will never be bad for the financial markets ever again.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008, the powers that be decided to patch the old system up. Instead of addressing the root causes of the crisis, they chose to paper over our problems instead, and now we are in the terminal phase of the biggest financial bubble in history.\\n\\nThis time around, it is absolutely imperative that we do things differently. The Federal Reserve is the primary reason why our economy is on an endless roller coaster ride. We have had 18 distinct recessions or depressions since 1913, and now another one is about to begin. By endlessly manipulating the system, they have caused these cycles of booms and busts, and it is time to get off of this roller coaster once and for all.\\n\\nLike Ron Paul, I believe that we need to shut down the Federal Reserve and get our banks under control. I also believe that we should abolish the federal income tax and go to a much fairer system. From 1872 to 1913, there was no central bank and no federal income tax, and it was the greatest period of economic growth in U.S. history. If we rebuild our financial system on sound principles, we could actually have a shot at a prosperous future. If not, the long-term future for our economy looks exceedingly bleak.\\n\\nIf you believe in what I am trying to do, I would like to ask for your help. I am running for Congress in Idaho’s First Congressional District, and since there is no incumbent running for this seat the race is completely wide open. Every time I share my message, more voters are coming over to my side, and if I am able to get my message out to every voter in this district I will win.\\n\\nAnd I would like to encourage like-minded people to run for positions all over the country on the federal, state and local levels. Individually, there is a limit to what we can do, but if we work together we can build a movement which could turn this nation completely upside down.\\n\\nMichael Snyder is a Republican candidate for Congress in Idaho’s First Congressional District, and you can learn how you can get involved in the campaign on his official website.

       " ('Are we running out of time? For the last several years, we have been living in a false bubble of hope that has been fueled by massive amounts of debt and bailout money. This illusion of economic stability has convinced most people that the great economic crisis of 2008 was just an “aberration” and that now things are back to normal. Unfortunately, that is not the case at all. The truth is that the financial crash of 2008 was just the first wave of our economic troubles. We have not even come close to recovering from that wave, and the next wave of the economic collapse is rapidly approaching. Our economy is like a giant sand castle that has been built on a foundation of debt and toilet paper currency. As each wave of the crisis hits us, the solutions that our leaders will present to us will involve even more debt and even more money printing. And each time, those “solutions” will only make our problems even worse. Right now, events are unfolding in Europe and in the United States that are pushing us toward the next major crisis moment. I sincerely hope that we have some more time before the next crisis overwhelms us, but as you will see, time is rapidly running out.\\n\\nThe following are 12 things that just happened that show the next wave of the economic collapse is almost here…\\n\\n#1 According to TrimTab’s CEO Charles Biderman, corporate insider purchases of stock have hit an all-time low, and the ratio of corporate insider selling to corporate insider buying has now reached an astounding 50 to 1….\\n\\nWhile retail is being told to buy-buy-buy, Biderman exclaims that “insiders at U.S. companies have bought the least amount of shares in any one month,” and that the ratio of insider selling to buying is now 50-to-1 – a monthly record.\\n\\n#2 On Friday we learned that personal income in the United States experienced its largest one month decline in 20 years…\\n\\nPersonal income decreased by $505.5 billion in January, or 3.6%, compared to December (on a seasonally adjusted and annualized basis). That’s the most dramatic decline since January 1993, according to the Commerce Department.\\n\\n#3 In a stunning move, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder says that he will appoint an emergency financial manager to take care of Detroit’s financial affairs…\\n\\nSnyder, 54, took a step he avoided a year ago, empowering an emergency financial manager who can sweep aside union contracts, sell municipal assets, restructure services and reorder finances. He announced the move yesterday at a public meeting in Detroit.\\n\\nIf this does not work, Detroit will almost certainly have to declare bankruptcy. If that happens, it will be the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.\\n\\n#4 On Friday it was announced that the unemployment rate in Italy had risen to 11.7 percent. That was a huge jump from 11.3 percent the previous month, and Italy now has the highest unemployment rate that it has experienced in 21 years.\\n\\n#5 The youth unemployment rate in Italy has risen to a new all-time record high of 38.7 percent.\\n\\n#6 On Friday it was announced that the unemployment rate in the eurozone as a whole had just hit a brand new record high of 11.9 percent.\\n\\n#7 On Friday it was announced that the unemployment rate in Greece has now reached 27 percent, and it is being projected that it will reach 30 percent by the end of the year.\\n\\n#8 The youth unemployment rate in Greece is now an almost unbelievable 59.4 percent.\\n\\n#9 On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of protesters filled the streets of Lisbon and other Portuguese cities to protest the austerity measures that are being imposed upon them. It was reportedly the largest protest in the history of Portugal.\\n\\n#10 According to Goldman Sachs, bank deposits declined all over Europe during the month of January.\\n\\n#11 Over the weekend, the deputy governor of China’s central bank declared that China is prepared for a “currency war“…\\n\\nA top Chinese banker said Beijing is “fully prepared” for a currency war as he urged the world to abide by a consensus reached by the G20 to avert confrontation, state media reported on Saturday. Yi Gang, deputy governor of China’s central bank, issued the call after G20 finance ministers last month moved to calm fears of a looming war on the currency markets at a meeting in Moscow. Those fears have largely been fuelled by the recent steep decline in the Japanese yen, which critics have accused Tokyo of manipulating to give its manufacturers a competitive edge in key export markets over Asian rivals.\\n\\n#12 Italy is an economic basket case at this point, and the political gridlock in Italy is certainly not helping matters. Former comedian Beppe Grillo’s party could potentially tip the balance of power one way or the other in Italy, and over the weekend he made some comments that are really shaking things up over in Europe. For one thing, he is suggesting that Italy should hold a referendum on the euro…\\n\\n“I am a strong advocate of Europe. I am in favor of an online referendum on the euro,” Beppe Grillo told Bild am Sonntag. Such a vote would not be legally binding in Italy, where referendums can only be used to repeal laws or parts of laws, but would carry political weight. Grillo has said in the past that membership of the euro should be up to the Italian people.\\n\\nIn addition, Grillo is also suggesting that Italy’s debt has gotten so large that renegotiation is the only option…\\n\\nIn an interview with a German magazine published on Saturday, Mr Grillo said that “if conditions do not change” Italy “will want” to leave the euro and return to its former national currency.\\n\\nThe 64-year-old comic-turned-political activist also said Italy needs to renegotiate its €2 trillion debt. At 127 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), it is the highest in the euro zone after Greece.',\n",

       " ('Are you willing to bet against three of the wealthiest men in the entire world? Jacob Rothschild recently bet approximately 200 million dollars that the euro will go down. Billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson made somewhere around 20 billion dollars betting against the U.S. housing market during the last financial crisis, and now he has made huge bets that the euro will go down and that the price of gold will go up. And as I wrote about in my last article, George Soros put approximately 130 million more dollars into gold last quarter. So will the euro plummet like a rock? Will the price of gold absolutely soar? Well, if a massive financial disaster does occur both of those two things are likely to happen. The European economy is becoming more unstable with each passing day, and investors all over the globe are looking for safe places to put their money. The mainstream media keeps telling us that everything is going to be okay, but the global elite are sending us a much, much different message by their actions. Certainly Rothschild, Paulson and Soros know about things happening in the financial world that the rest of us don’t. The fact that they are all behaving in a consistent manner right now should be alarming for all of us.\\n\\nLet’s start with Jacob Rothschild. Apparently he believes that the euro is headed for quite a tumble. The following is from a recent CNBC article….\\n\\nYou know the euro is in deep water when a doyen of the banking industry, Lord Jacob Rothschild takes a £130 million ($200 million) bet against it.\\n\\nOkay, but the euro has already been falling dramatically. In mid-2011, the EUR/USD was above the 1.40 mark, and right now it is at about 1.23.\\n\\nDoes it really have that much more that it can fall?\\n\\nIf the eurozone ends up breaking apart it sure does.\\n\\nIf there is a Greek default, or if Germany leaves the euro, or if a new currency comes along to replace the euro those currently betting against it will end up looking like geniuses.\\n\\nAnother big name in the financial world that is betting against the euro right now is John Paulson. The following is from a recent Der Spiegel article….\\n\\nOne of these warriors is John Paulson. The hedge fund manager once made billions by betting on a collapse of the American real estate market. Not surprisingly, the financial world sat up and took notice when Paulson, who is now widely despised in America as a crisis profiteer, announced in the spring that he would bet on a collapse of the euro.\\n\\nAnd as I noted in my last article, Paulson has also been putting billions of dollars into gold.\\n\\nSo just what are Rothschild and Paulson anticipating?\\n\\nCould we be on the verge of a massive financial collapse in Europe?\\n\\nAccording to the Der Spiegel article mentioned above, a lot of investors seem to be preparing for such a possibility right now….\\n\\nBanks, companies and investors are preparing themselves for a collapse of the euro. Cross-border bank lending is falling, asset managers are shunning Europe and money is flowing into German real estate and bonds. The euro remains stable against the dollar because America has debt problems too. But unlike the euro, the dollar’s structure isn’t in doubt.\\n\\nThe financial world is starting to wake up to the fact that the globe is absolutely drowning in debt and it is not really good to be holding fiat currencies when a debt crisis erupts.\\n\\nWhen men like John Paulson and George Soros start pouring huge amounts of money into gold, it is time to start becoming alarmed about the state of the global financial system.\\n\\nThe amount of money that these men are investing in gold is staggering….\\n\\nThere was also news last week in an SEC filing that both George Soros and John Paulson had increased their investment in SPDR Gold Trust, the world’s largest publicly traded physical gold exchange traded fund (ETF). Mr Soros upped his stake in the ETF to 884,400 shares from 319,550 and Mr Paulson bought 4.53m shares, bringing his stake to 21.3m. At the current price of about $156 a share, these are new investments of about $88m of Mr Soros’ cash and more than $700m from Mr Paulson’s funds. These are significant positions.\\n\\nAnd the central banks of the world are certainly buying gold at an unprecedented rate as well. According to the World Gold Council, the central banks of the world added 157.5 metric tons of gold last quarter. That was the biggest move into gold by the central banks of the globe that we have seen in modern financial history.\\n\\nBut that might just be the beginning.\\n\\nAccording to a recent Marketwatch article, there are persistent rumors that China has plans to buy thousands of metric tons of gold….\\n\\nWithin the gold market, there is unconfirmed speculation that China plans to buy up to at least 5,000 to 6,000 metric tons of gold and that it will start to buy during this year, according to Kevin Kerr, president of Kerr Trading International. If China buys this much gold, that would exceed annual, global production of gold, he said. “We do not have enough gold for China to buy that much, and it will take China time to purchase this amount of gold.”\\n\\nSo what comes next?\\n\\nNobody is quite sure.\\n\\nAnother major financial crisis could erupt in Europe at any moment.\\n\\nA major war in the Middle East could start literally at any time.\\n\\nRenowned investor Jim Rogers believes that things are really going to get “bad after the next election“.\\n\\nOthers believe that the action could start even sooner than that.\\n\\nThe truth is that even though we have not seen a “Lehman Brothers moment” yet, things in Europe just continue to get progressively worse. The following is from a recent article by Mark E. Grant….\\n\\nWhether you turn your attention to Greece, Spain, Italy, Portugal or even Ireland; it is getting worse. Nowhere on the Continent are things improving and even in France and Germany the financial strains are beginning to show. It is not a question of Euro-bear or Euro-bull; it is just the numbers as they come rolling out month after month.\\n\\nThere is a growing realization in Europe that the euro simply does not work. Italy is absolutely drowning in debt, the Spanish economy has basically descended into a depression, and Greece has been experiencing depression-like conditions for years at this point.\\n\\nThe euro is doomed. The only question is who is going to blink first.\\n\\nNobody wants to be the first to leave the euro. There are rumblings that it could actually be Finland that leaves the euro first, and that would please Germany just fine because they don’t want to look like the bad guys in all of this.\\n\\nBut that doesn’t mean that Germany won’t eventually pull the trigger if nobody else does. The German public is sick and tired of bailing out the weak sisters of southern Europe, and at this point it looks like it would take perpetual bailouts just to keep the euro together.\\n\\nAnd recently there have been lots of little signs that Germany is starting to move slowly toward the exit doors.\\n\\nIn fact, I found it quite interesting that a giant euro sculpture was recently removed from the Frankfurt International Airport….\\n\\nA massive € sculpture (identical to the one in front of the European Central Bank) was dismantled and removed from the Frankfurt International Airport in Germany Thursday. The official explanation is ‘the plastic parts are getting weak after 11 years and the terminal needed the space‘. Does € sculpture’s removal from the Frankfurt Airport indicate Germany is preparing for a surprise return to the Deutsche Mark?\\n\\nSure that might just be a coincidence, but it also could be a harbinger of things to come.\\n\\nSadly, most average people living in North America and Europe have absolutely no idea what is coming. Most of them just want to be able to get up in the morning and go to work and pay the bills and take care of their families.\\n\\nUnfortunately, millions upon millions of those hard working individuals are in for a very rude awakening.\\n\\nA lot of people are about to have their current lifestyles totally turned upside down.\\n\\nBut it doesn’t have to be all bad.\\n\\nIn fact, I found it very interesting to read about how some young people are responding to the depression in Greece….\\n\\nIn the spring of 2010, just as the Greek government was embarking on some of its harshest austerity measures, 29-year-old Apostolos Sianos packed in his well-paid job as a website designer, gave up his Athens apartment and walked away from modern civilisation. In the foothills of Mount Telaithrion on the Greek island of Evia, Mr Sianos and three other like-minded Athenians set up an eco-community. The idea was to live in an entirely sustainable way, free from the ties of money and cut off from the national electricity grid. The group sleeps communally in yurts they have built themselves, they grow their own food and exchange the surplus in the nearest village for any necessities they cannot produce.\\n\\nI think there is a lesson to be learned there.\\n\\nWhen the system fails, it is going to be important to be able to live independently of the system.\\n\\nGovernments and big banks all over the world have been rapidly preparing for the coming financial collapse.\\n\\nPerhaps the rest of us should be too.\\n\\nIf you can believe it, 77 percent of all Americans live paycheck to paycheck at least some of the time.\\n\\nIf another major economic crisis comes along, many of those people are going to be totally wiped out.\\n\\nAnd there are already signs that the U.S. economy is basically on life support at this point.\\n\\nJust look at the velocity of money.\\n\\nIn an economy that is growing and healthy, money tends to circulate very, very quickly.\\n\\nBut when an economy is sick, money tends to circulate very slowly.\\n\\nAnd that is exactly what is happening right now. In fact, the velocity of money is currently at the lowest level in modern U.S. history….\\n\\nFor much more discussion on this, please check out this article.\\n\\nThis is exactly what happened back in the 1930s. The velocity of money absolutely plummeted. When people are scared, credit is tight and times are hard, money does not exchange hands as rapidly.\\n\\nBut this is just the beginning.\\n\\nWhat we are experiencing right now is rip-roaring prosperity compared to what is coming.\\n\\nJacob Rothschild, John Paulson and George Soros are preparing themselves for the tremendous chaos that is coming.\\n\\nAre you getting prepared?',\n",

       " ('Aristotle and Hamilton\\n\\non Commerce and Statesmanship\\n\\nby Michael D. Chan\\n\\nMissouri, 236 pp., $44.95\\n\\nCritics of America make endless complaints. Our liberty is selfish license that corrodes community. Our equality is a fraud that barely veils vast gaps between the undeserving rich and the undeservedly poor. Our silly arts seek a common denominator ever lower and more vulgar. Our faith is narrow-minded, irrational, priggish, and hypocritical. Our sciences threaten to destroy or degrade us. Our mad consumption leaves nothing for the future. What\\'s more, we spread our corruption globally through imperial might wrapped in the delusion that it is liberal justice.\\n\\nHearing all this, one would think that American life is solitary, poor, nasty, and brutish, and our power soon to be thankfully short.\\n\\nThese concerns are excessive because they project the worst possibilities as if they were actual or inevitable, and not counteracted by better ones. Freedom is enterprise and responsibility, not only license. Equality is equality in rights whose exercise leads unsurprisingly to inequalities in wealth. Faith and reason can be generously allied. Outposts of beauty and intellect stand against our encroaching wilderness. Science properly guided is beneficial. Limiting or transforming tyrannies abroad serves foreign citizens as well as our own.\\n\\nAlthough these criticisms of America are excessive, they are not altogether absurd. Most mirror old concerns, theoretical and practical. Democracy means vulgarity, and we are democratic. Abstraction corrodes habit and seeks general sway, and we are based on universal principles. Unchecked individual ends demand unlimited technological means, and our desires seem unbounded. Commerce may allow opportunity but, in time, it favors those already wealthy.\\n\\nSo, although the United States is a living answer to the excesses of these worries, we are successful only because our policies and principles take them seriously.\\n\\nMichael Chan\\'s practical purpose in Aristotle and Hamilton is to defend America by showing that we are not as bad as excessive criticism makes us seem. His vehicle is to show how Alexander Hamilton believed that American commerce and manufacturing would enhance not just prosperity but also our security, union, virtue, and a liberal public good that would support the arts and sciences and end slavery.\\n\\nChan also has two theoretical purposes. One is to recast the debate about the relative importance of liberal acquisitiveness and so-called republican virtue in the American founding. He shows, through Hamilton, that commerce and virtue need not contradict, and reminds us of the slave-owning self-interestedness often disguised by Virginians\\' republican blather.\\n\\nHis other, related, academic purpose is to narrow the gap between ancient and modern (post-Machiavellian) thinkers. He does this by showing that Aristotle was friendlier to commerce than he appears, and Hamilton friendlier to virtue. For each, the economic is subordinate to the properly political, and the properly political an arm or element of excellence.\\n\\nThe salutary effect of Chan\\'s work is to increase or reaffirm one\\'s admiration for his three protagonists--Aristotle, Hamilton, and the United States of America--by showing where each is consistent with the others. Hamilton\\'s political sagacity is, in Chan\\'s presentation, especially impressive, almost startlingly so. As best one can tell, he was correct about almost every important issue. The one exception is national expansion, where Hamilton\\'s reasons for opposition were good (he feared that more land would mean a continuing agrarian economy) but manifestly not good enough.\\n\\nThe crux of Chan\\'s discussion is virtue. That countries devoted to commercial acquisitiveness would diminish their citizens\\' characters was once the chief complaint against them. Today, despite a generation of discussion, the complaint (lodged in these terms) still seems slightly quaint. It enters the list with which I began mostly indirectly. Yet the problem of virtue is vital to whatever is reasonable in each of our current concerns.\\n\\nImmorality is also a major fault that Islamic religious tyrants find with the West. Moreover, their view that we are soft and weak encourages their hopes or fantasies of fundamentalist Islamic reconquest and rebirth. So by exploring and challenging \"the virtue-commerce antinomy,\" Chan exposes both the classical core and virulent contemporary expression of unease or distress with acquisitive liberal democracy.\\n\\nChan discusses Hamilton\\'s view of the link between virtue and commerce--or, more broadly, the political goals of his economic recommendations--under five headings. He summarizes his position in advance by claiming that \"Hamilton recognized a need for ancient as well as modern prudence in the practice of politics.\" The advantages of commerce outweigh disadvantages such as vicious luxury and moral licentiousness. I will report Chan\\'s main points, but cannot do justice to the subtlety and intricacy of his arguments.\\n\\nFirst is the contribution that commerce and manufacturing make to national prosperity, a contribution that depends on equal freedom: \"True liberty, by protecting the exertions of talents and industry and securing to them their justly acquired fruits, tends more powerfully than any other cause to augment the mass of national wealth.\" Indeed, the American \"spirit of enterprise,\" writes Chan, \"is in itself an inexhaustible mine of national wealth.\" Hamilton believed it \"easier and more humane\" to arrange matters so that interest and ambition, rather than fierce courage and self-renouncing public spiritedness, are the major supports of the public good.\\n\\nHamilton also argued that vigorous commerce aids national defense. The Revolutionary War led him to see that \"only a nation with a manufacturing base and an advanced system of public finance\" would win wars, because war has been revolutionized by the modern \"arts of industry and the science of finance.\" In addition, manufacturing would especially benefit from technology, for Hamilton believed it particularly well suited to the use and invention of machines.\\n\\nHamilton also thought that national commerce would help to cement the federal union and produce \"a distinctly American economy.\" It would serve our mutual wants, and tie manufacturing to agriculture, as long as statesmen helped citizens to see that their enlightened self-interest required such a blend. Commerce also would \"promote a gradual assimilation of temper and sentiments among citizens.\"\\n\\nThe political goals commerce serves are connected to Hamilton\\'s belief that \"commercial virtue\" is \"necessary for a prosperous, orderly, and just nation.\" The traditional view of the moral superiority of farmers is incorrect. Farmers\\' agitation for debt relief and easy money shows that they are more self-interested than pure. Indeed, the agrarian South and West depended on slavery, an institution more corrupt than anything commerce and manufacturing fostered.\\n\\nBy contrast, commerce and manufacturing give regular work to many not usually engaged in business, and furnish great \"scope for the diversity of talents and dispositions among individuals.\" They make men more industrious and inventive, and expand their choices. Manufacturing, especially, gives the able opportunities for spirited and useful enterprise. And because a commercial nation depends on sound money and banks, it also encourages \"punctuality, thrift, industry, responsibility in fulfilling contracts, and prudent financial management.\"\\n\\nFinally, Hamilton thought that commerce would provide resources to enhance \"public splendor,\" liberality, and national greatness. The \"moral horizon of American politics\" is more than \"the ceaseless pursuit of security and prosperity.\" Liberality would replace the ancient republics\\' \"excessive devotion to . . . military glory.\"\\n\\nHamilton\\'s challenge here \"was to reconcile magnanimity or the longing for splendor among great men with the natural rights of mankind, or consent.\" Commerce would allow the ambitious to \"build great commercial empires\" and practice liberality grounded on agreement, not slavery and plunder. Indeed, consent and affection, as opposed to fear, served \"not only to limit but also to invigorate the powers of government.\"\\n\\nThe chief \"enlarged plans of public good\" that Hamilton had in mind for the United States were to promote industry, secure the independence of the new world from the old, end slavery, and advance the arts and sciences. Beyond his own efforts through foreign policy and state abolition societies, Hamilton thought that industrial, mechanical, and commercial development is the best economic alternative to slavery, and further undermines it by \"softening and humanizing\" mores, especially those of masterful men. Commerce also provides leisure to cultivate the arts and sciences and resources to communicate enlightened opinion. Here, government needs to support institutions such as a national university where there is little prospect of immediate economic gain.\\n\\nChan makes clear how, in Hamilton\\'s eyes, commerce and industry serve political, ethical, and intellectual ends greater than wealth alone, and are coherent with prudence and virtue. Chan\\'s discussion is a highly intelligent contribution to the theoretical and practical issues he faces, and makes telling and sometimes novel use of The Federalist, Report on Manufactures, and Hamilton\\'s other works.\\n\\nTo address these matters more completely, of course, we would need to consider additional questions. One is the problem of religion or religious toleration, especially important in light of Islamic opposition to the West. Hamilton\\'s acquisitive, energetic, commercial, manufacturing republic is no friend to the dominance of a single religion, or the dominance of religion simply. It weakens communal rootedness and strengthens secular excitement and opportunity. This dilutes religious attachments, even beyond the effect of legal tolerance.\\n\\nIs this attenuation something that liberal political Founders expected, desired, or ignored? Did they believe, say, that the kind of faith Tocqueville noticed would survive or grow, or would even this have surprised them? Aristotle\\'s virtue seems largely secular, if not wholly so, not merely pre-Christian, and therefore friendly to pride and magnificence, but also secured without excessive reliance on the gods.\\n\\nIs this secular emphasis also true of modern liberalism? To fully grasp the effect of commerce on virtue, especially today, we should, in addition to other questions, examine the link between virtue and piety, or morality and faithful obedience. How, in particular, did Hamilton see the effect of his economics on religion, and the effect of religion on morality? Chan touches on this question near the end, but does not explore it.\\n\\nAlso connected to this problem is how Hamilton would have demonstrated the rationality of natural rights. This is unclear in Chan\\'s presentation. Belief in humans\\' natural equality provides a substantial foundation for freedom, property, and responsibility. But this equality is secured best as a natural truth, not a mere opinion. Only in its rational universalism is this belief a sufficient check on--and indication of superiority to--an obedient faith whose sway, however vast, cannot accord with reason.\\n\\nNatural rights do not tell us all that reason can about natural excellence. Consent based on equal rights is always in some tension with intellectual virtue. The task of closing the gap between ancients and moderns is limited not just by differences of belief and circumstance, but by the variety of natural truths among which prudence must, in practice, steer. To explore this question you would need to pair Aristotle or Plato with someone other than Alexander Hamilton, who, as Chan informs us, did not pretend to be philosophic.\\n\\nI was a member of Michael Chan\\'s dissertation committee, a fact I reveal in the hope that kind (or moralistic) readers will now attribute my mistakes to accidental prejudice rather than incorrigible foolishness! The excellent book he has shaped from his thesis is a bulwark against the degrading of American principles. It is also a safeguard against complacent patriotism.\\n\\nMark Blitz, Fletcher Jones professor of political philosophy at Claremont McKenna College, is most recently the author of Duty Bound: Responsibility and American Public Life.',\n",

       " ('As 2014 was closing a vote on a draft resolution introduced by the Jordanian UN Ambassador at the Security Council hit what may be a temporary speed bump for PA President Abbas. He is striving g to impose a draconian solution to the long simmering dispute on the Jewish nation of Israel. The draft resolution failed to achieve the requisite 9 votes, losing by one vote. The US and Australia voted no. Five others abstained including the UK, Lithuania, South Korea and Nigeria. France, Luxembourg, Russia, China, Jordan, Chile, Argentina, and Chad voted in favor of the draft resolution. The draft resolution sought to fix a one year deadline for negotiations on declaration of a Palestinian state with its capital in East Jerusalem based on the infamous War 1949 Armistice line. What fabled Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban deemed the “Auschwitz line”. The draft resolution would require the end of the alleged ‘occupation’ of the West Bank by Israel losing its control over the Jordan Valley approaches and protection of over 350,000 Israelis in both Samaria and Judea.\\n\\nVirtually on the announcement of the vote, PA President Abbas, now serving in the tenth year of an elected four year term, signed 20 UN covenants including the Rome Treaty making it eligible for observer status at the International Criminal Court (ICC) at The Hague. That would enable it to bring a charge of war crimes against Israel. This will confront the ICC with a choice between recognition of anti-Israel issues versus international law matters. Further, the unilateral move by Abbas will likely cause the incoming GOP led Congress to consider retaliatory legislation further consternating Administration diplomacy in the region. Israeli PM Netanyahu countered saying:\\n\\nThe one who should fear the International Criminal Court at The Hague is the Palestinian Authority, which is in a unity government with Hamas, a declared terrorist organization like ISIS that commits war crimes. We will take steps in response and we will defend the soldiers of the IDF, the most moral army in the world. We will repel this latest effort to force diktats on us, just as we have repelled the Palestinian turn to the UN Security Council.\\n\\nUS UN Ambassador Power blasted the PA vote because it precluded consideration of security guarantees outlined in UNSC Res. 242 for Israel to have defensible borders. She noted in her remarks, “The deadlines in the resolution take no account of Israel’s legitimate security concerns.” The State Department director of its press office, Jeff Rathke, criticized the PA saying:\\n\\nWe are deeply troubled by today’s Palestinian action regarding the ICC. Today’s action is entirely counterproductive and does nothing to further the aspirations of the Palestinian people for a sovereign and independent state.\\n\\nPalestinian Resolution reprise Veto\\n\\nBesides the ICC ploy, the PA was anything but supine. The change in the non-permanent membership of the UNSC might afford them another opportunity to re-submit the draft resolution, possibly obtaining the requisite 9 votes. As former US UN Ambassador John Bolton in a Wall Street Journal op Ed published today, “The U.N. Vote on Palestine Was a Rehearsal,” wrote, “An influx of new Security Council members means a likely ‘yes’ vote – and a veto dilemma for Obama.” Obama, as we have noted previously in Jeffrey Goldberg’s Atlantic interview gave a broad hint that the US might abstain.\\n\\nBolton notes in his WSJ op ed the elements of this dilemma that may shortly face the Administration:\\n\\nA firmer U.S. strategy might have prevented the dilemma from arising. The White House’s opening diplomatic error was in sending strong signals to the media and U.S. allies that Mr. Obama, wary of offending Arab countries, was reluctant to veto any resolution favoring a Palestinian state. Secretary of State John Kerry took pains not to offer a view of the resolution before it was taken up. Such equivocation was a mistake because even this administration asserts that a permanent resolution of the Israeli-Arab conflict requires direct negotiations and agreements among the parties themselves. No draft resolution contrary to these precepts should be acceptable to the U.S., or worth wasting time on in the diplomatic pursuit of a more moderate version. This American view, advocated for years and backed by resolute threats to veto anything that contradicted it, has previously dissuaded the Palestinians from blue-smoke-and-mirror projects in the Security Council.\\n\\nBolton addresses how the reprise could shortly occur:\\n\\nSeveral factors support a swift Palestinian reprise. First, they obtained a majority of the Security Council’s votes, even if not the required supermajority of nine. In today’s U.N., the eight affirmative votes constitute a moral victory that virtually demand vindication, and sooner rather than later. Second, the text of Jordan’s resolution was wildly unbalanced even by U.N. standards—for example, it demands a solution that “brings an end to the Israeli occupation since 1967,” and calls for “security arrangements, including through a third-party presence, that guarantee and respect the sovereignty of a State of Palestine.” A few meaningless tweaks here and there and several countries that abstained could switch to “yes.” Third, on Jan. 1 five of the Security Council’s 10 nonpermanent members stepped down (their two-year terms ended), replaced by five new members more likely to support the Palestinian effort. Consider how Wednesday’s vote broke down, and what the future may hold. Three of the Security Council’s five permanent members (France, China and Russia) supported Jordan’s draft. France’s stance is particularly irksome, since it provides cover for other Europeans to vote “yes.” The U.K. timidly abstained, proving that David Cameron is no Margaret Thatcher; the abstention signals that a more “moderately” worded resolution might be enough to flip London to a “yes.” Washington cast the only permanent member’s “no” vote, which is characterized as a veto only when nine or more Security Council members vote in a draft resolution’s favor. Will President Obama now have the stomach to cast a real veto against a U.N. Charter majority backing the Palestinians? Is this the point where the “liberated” Mr. Obama allows a harsh anti-Israel resolution to pass? Happy New Year, Jerusalem.\\n\\nHe notes the lineup of new rotating non-permanent members in the UNSC that could tip the vote over the required 9 votes:\\n\\nThree “yes” votes came from Jordan, Chad and Chile, which all remain Security Council members in 2015. Two additional supporters, Argentina and Luxembourg, have been replaced, respectively, by Venezuela (no suspense there) and Spain. Spain narrowly won election in October, defeating Turkey after three ballots. Madrid might be expected to support Washington, but not necessarily, given recent EU hostility to Israel and the appeasers’ argument to soothe wounded Muslim feelings about Turkey’s loss by backing the Palestinians. Only Australia joined the U.S. in voting “no.” Its successor, New Zealand, would either have abstained or voted affirmatively, according to Foreign Minister Murray McCully. South Korea abstained, but its replacement, Malaysia, is a certain affirmative vote. Angola, taking Rwanda’s seat, is an abstention at best. While abstainers Lithuania and Nigeria remain, Nigeria’s Boko Haram problem could easily move it to “yes” as an olive branch to the Muslim world. And Lithuania, as a new member of the euro currency union, could well succumb to arguments for EU solidarity, especially if Britain also surrenders.\\n\\nBolton notes in conclusion:\\n\\nThe Obama administration can only prevent what it dreads by openly embracing a veto strategy, hoping thereby to dissuade pro-Palestinian states from directly confronting the U.S. And if that fails, the veto should be cast firmly and resolutely, as we normally advocate our principles, not apologetically. As so often before on Middle Eastern issues, a veto would neither surprise nor offend most Arab governments. If the Administration had courage enough to make clear that a veto was inevitable, it would minimize whatever collateral damage might ensue in Arab lands. But don’t hold your breath.\\n\\nIran Sanctions Veto\\n\\nHowever, this is not the only veto dilemma facing the Administration in 2015. On Tuesday, December 30, 2014, Reuters reported that Undersecretary of The Treasury for Finance and Terrorism, David Cohen issued new financial sanctions “against nine targets who Washington says have helped Tehran avoid existing sanctions or commit human rights abuses.” The IRNA news agency noted these comments by an Iranian foreign ministry spokeswoman, Marzieh Afkham saying: “At a time negotiations are underway with P5+1, such a move raises doubts about America’s intentions and violates the good will principles” “This action is for mere publicity and will have no bearing whatsoever on our commercial policies,”\\n\\nJust prior to the onset of Republican control of the 114th Session of Congress on January 6, 2015, Illinois Senator Mark Kirk gave an interview on December 28, 2014 on Fox News Sunday following statements by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham that new sanctions against Iran’s nuclear program may be brought up for an early vote.\\n\\nThat followed an NPR interview with President Obama that he might be prepared to use his veto authority on specific legislation passed by the new Congress. Kirk in the Sunday Fox interview indicated that 17 Democrats, including New Jersey’s Bob Menendez and New York’s Charles Schumer may have the requisite votes to pass new stronger sanctions legislation against Iran’s nuclear program in view of the Islamic regime fobbing off failed P5+1 negotiations . Those 17 Democratic Senate votes would make such a measure veto proof. This puts President Obama in a difficult situation regarding his engagement of the Islamic Regime in Tehran. A regime that has successfully outmaneuvered the P5+1 and Administration and likely has already achieved nuclear breakout. Omri Ceren chronicled this in a Commentary article,“Enabling Iran’s Nukes” saying, “The lies began at the very beginning with American assurances had secured a ‘halt’ in Iranian nuclear program.” This is a matter of great concern to Israel’s PM Netanyahu who would support such Congressional action on tougher Iran sanctions. Watch the Fox News interview with Sen. Kirk.\\n\\nIran is feeling the ravaging of its economy due to the loss of revenue from oil and gas production. Given the precipitous fall in world energy prices, due in part to the drop in demand and the vaulting of US energy production to first rank in 2015. That has forced Iran to suggest that fellow OPEC member Saudi Arabia cooperates to cut production. This is an unlikely prospect since the Saudis are unwilling to relent given their $750 billion dollar hard currency reserve cushion.\\n\\nWe shall shortly see whether President Obama will issue vetoes at the UNSC against a reprise of the Palestinian draft resolution and another against tougher sanctions legislation passed on a bi-partisan basis in the new Republican controlled Congress against the Iranian nuclear program.\\n\\nEDITORS NOTE: This column originally appeared in the New English Review.',\n",

(This is an excerpt of the full interview to air this weekend on \"Conversations With Judy Woodruff.\" Source: Bloomberg) Wall Street banks reaping profits and paying bonuses while the rest of the country struggles shows \"we still have a problem\" with economic disparity, said Elizabeth Warren, the Obama administration adviser responsible for setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \"This just staggers me; I mean, I just don\\'t have words to describe what this means,\" she said in an interview for Bloomberg Television\\'s \"Conversations With Judy Woodruff\" that will be broadcast this weekend. \"For me, what an economic recovery is about is about what happens to American families. It\\'s what happens in the real economy. It\\'s whether or not families are building up wealth in their homes or whether or not their homes are dragging them over an economic cliff.\" \"It isn\\'t meaningful to talk about profits and a growing economy until American families are stabilized,\" she said...\\n\\n\\n\\nCLASS DISPARITY METRICS HAVE NEVER BEEN GREATER THAN THEY ARE TODAY\\n\\nEven Zero Hedge reminded us on Friday of \"...what is gradually becoming accepted as the most troubling social, economic and political development in America - record social, income and wealth inequality... and its very disturbing consequences, which at last check have resulted in some form of social upheaval in almost every situation. \"\\n\\nWE ARE CREATING \"A POTENTIAL LOST GENERATION OF YOUNG AMERICANS\"\\n\\nCharles Blow had a very brief column in Saturday\\'s NY Times, \"America\\'s Most Vulnerable,\" which, aside from a mention in the DKos \"Pundit Roundup,\" generated nary a word in the community.\\n\\n\\n\\nAmerica\\'s Most Vulnerable\\n\\nBy CHARLES M. BLOW\\n\\nNew York Times\\n\\nDecember 11, 2010 As we begin inevitably wrangling over budget cuts and other austerity measures, we must not lose sight of the plight of the most vulnerable among us -- the ones who have little say and few choices: the nation\\'s poorest children. The gap between those children and the rest of our children is already unacceptably wide, and it can\\'t afford to get wider. In fact, a report entitled \"The Children Left Behind,\" released by Unicef last Friday, examined inequality in well-being on a wide range of measures among children in 24 of the world\\'s richest countries. America\\'s rankings were among the worst. Parents play a large role in this inequality, but so do policies. As the report wisely asks, \"Is there a point beyond which falling behind is not inevitable but policy susceptible, not unavoidable but unacceptable, not inequality but inequity?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nEconomist and Netroots Nation discussion leader Mike Konzcal put up some stats on Friday concerning the, \"Employment-Population Ratio, Young People: A Potential Lost Generation Of Young Americans.\"\\n\\n(I have a niece majoring in journalism in her senior year at a major university who\\'s looking around for an internship, and she found out about an opportunity at the Philadelphia Inquirer. After further investigation, she discovered that the paper\\'s policy was that interns have to pay the paper $600 to participate in the program! There\\'s more about this in Konzcal\\'s post, below, in the link: \"Interns Built the Pyramids.\")\\n\\n\\n\\nEmployment-Population Ratio, Young People: A Potential Lost Generation Of Young Americans.\\n\\nMike Konczal\\n\\nRortybomb.com\\n\\nDecember 10, 2010 Ed Burmila walks through the horror of trend stories about happy, young, unpaid interns on-the-go in Interns Built the Pyramids. Anyone who works with young people is aware of the lack of jobs and opportunities, from the most disadvantaged through those who leave college with fresh skills. The lucky end up in non-paying internships, a nice little inequality generating machine for the 21st century. If you wonder why people are so worried about the current unemployment crisis, look at these two statistics of the employment-population ratio rate of young people in the United States: CHART: Employment-Population Ratio, Young People (Seasonally Adjusted) A 10% drop in the amount of young people working as a result of this recession. That\\'s 10% more people detached from the labor market and with decades of lost wages. That\\'s 10% more people with fewer opportunities to develop their capabilities and build the American economy over the 21st century. And that is a generational crisis unless we get a serious attempt to fix this economy and put people to work.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile our supposed \"representatives\" in government pass brutally-flawed, Bush tax cut extension legislation which all but insures an even greater economic crisis at the state and municipal level, in coming months, others speak of \"our generational crisis,\" and our need for \"a serious attempt to fix this economy and put people to work.\"\\n\\nSo, let\\'s talk about what\\'s really needed, not what misguided faux pragmatists tell us the corrupt \"process\" will \"allow,\" at this point in time. Because, basic logic tells us...\\n\\nMANAGERS OF A CORRUPT \"PROCESS\" WILL ONLY SUPPORT A CORRUPT \"SOLUTION\" (And, that is what we, in effect, have today.)\\n\\nSo, let\\'s talk about making all the RIGHT moves, and not settling for less.\\n\\nThis year, it\\'s about about the basics: the ongoing and projected suffering of our children, and those in our society \"too poor to make the news.\"\\n\\nSince when does being \"pragmatic\" mean we that we should ignore this? Or, this?\\n\\nIMHO, that means standing up and fighting for what you believe in; not arguing about why you can\\'t. It means reminding yourself--and everyone with whom you communicate--about what we should be doing, instead of bickering about the finer points of grossly-flawed initiatives; especially when those results wreak of fail from jump street (right through to the point where \"the fail\"--due to the corrupt process--becomes \"the law\").\\n\\nIt means pointing to the latest words from Nobel Prize-winner Joe Stiglitz (I\\'ll say it once again, and I\\'ve stated this in my diaries a dozen or more times before: Stiglitz gets my vote for being the most important thinker on the planet right now). Unfortunately, as University of Oregon Economics Professor Mark Thoma reminds us, Gary, Indiana-born Stiglitz\\' thoughts--widely revered virtually everywhere around the globe except here, at home--have: \"...little chance of being enacted because it goes [they go] against \\'corporate and other special interests that have come to dominate America\\'s policymaking.\\'\"\\n\\nIn tandem with that pragmatic truth, Stiglitz\\' progressive suggestions fly in the face of all the corporate kleptocracy and \"pragmatist\" bullshit being shovelled up by the status quo and their obedient MSM.\\n\\nMeanwhile, us \"unpragmatic\" progressives, along with the rest of the voting public, are observing our respective daily realities where we\\'re constantly reminded of:\\n\\n--record breaking class inequality that is getting worse;\\n\\n--joblessness going nowhere fast, and certainly not improving, appreciably;\\n\\n--a housing situation already in a double-dip recession;\\n\\n--and poverty growing by leaps and bounds\\n\\nSo, here\\'s Stiglitz reminding us of where the goalposts are as he notes that--contrary to government spin--a punt is not a field goal kick.\\n\\nFrom Mark Thoma: \"Stiglitz: Alternatives to Austerity.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nStiglitz: Alternatives to Austerity\\n\\nMark Thoma, University of Oregon Economics Professor\\n\\nEconomist\\'s View Blog\\n\\nDecember 6th, 2010 Joseph Stiglitz proposes a deficit reduction package that \"boosts efficiency, bolsters growth, and reduces inequality,\" but it has little chance of being enacted because it goes against \"corporate and other special interests that have come to dominate America\\'s policymaking.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nStiglitz....\\n\\n\\n\\nAlternatives to Austerity, by Joseph E. Stiglitz, Commentary, Project Syndicate: In the aftermath of the Great Recession, countries have been left with unprecedented peacetime deficits and increasing anxieties about their growing national debts. In many countries, this is leading to a new round of austerity... Technically, reducing a deficit is a straightforward matter: one must either cut expenditures or raise taxes. It is already clear, however, that the deficit-reduction agenda, at least in the US, goes further: it is an attempt to weaken social protections, reduce the progressivity of the tax system, and shrink the role and size of government - all while leaving established interests, like the military-industrial complex, as little affected as possible.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Nobel laureate tells us that any deficit-reduction effort must be viewed in the context of what has occurred over the past decade:\\n\\n--massive increase in our defense budget(s);\\n\\n--increased class inequality;\\n\\n--insufficient investment in the public sector;\\n\\n--growth in corporate welfare (encompassing everything from Wall Street bailouts to ethanol subsidies, and then onto continued agricultural subsidies)\\n\\nTo get a progressive deficit-reduction back on track, Stiglitz tells us it must be comprised of \"five core ingredients:\"\\n\\n-- spending on high-return public investments should be increased;\\n\\n-- military expenditures must be cut;\\n\\n-- we must eliminate corporate welfare;\\n\\n-- create a fairer and more efficient tax system, which would include eliminating the special treatment of capital gains and dividends;\\n\\n-- and, \"...finally, with more than 20% of all income going to the top 1%, a slight increase, say 5%, in taxes actually paid would bring in more than $1 trillion over the course of a decade\"\\n\\n\\n\\n...A deficit-reduction package crafted along these lines would more than meet even the most ardent deficit hawk\\'s demands. It would increase efficiency, promote growth, improve the environment, and benefit workers and the middle class. There\\'s only one problem: it wouldn\\'t benefit those at the top, or the corporate and other special interests that have come to dominate America\\'s policymaking. Its compelling logic is precisely why there is little chance that such a reasonable proposal would ever be adopted.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd, back to Thoma...\\n\\n\\n\\nThe successful objections to allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire for upper end taxpayers reinforces the claim that the deficit reduction agenda has been captured by powerful interests. Similarly with calls to increase the retirement age for Social Security, which is regressive, rather than the progressive solution of lifting the income cap on Social Security taxes. I\\'d be more confident about the deficit reduction process if I thought the White House would take strong stands to defend core Democratic interests. But it\\'s clear that the administration folds as soon as the negotiations gets tough, and that it cannot be trusted to do this.\\n\\n\\n\\n# # #\\n\\nAt the moment, it\\'s the holiday season, but as a Democrat I will say that there is NEVER a day in the 365 on the calendar where it\\'s politically expedient to throw our children, the poor and the middle class under the bus. And, IMHO, it\\'s one thing to kick the proverbial can down the road; it\\'s another matter, altogether, to banish future generations and those most in need in our society to a lifetime of hell.\\n\\nBut, that is what\\'s happened and what is STILL happening as I write this.\\n\\nDon\\'t take my word for it. But, please (if you are not now) make an effort to hear and understand what people such as Elizabeth Warren and Joseph Stiglitz are telling us now.',\n",

Alaska\\'s crime statistics. Troopergate. McCain\\'s stance on equal pay. None of these were addressed--in fact, the only time any of them were even referred to was when Joe Biden explained his change of heart about what criteria to use when considering judges (specifically, Robert Bork), and made a passing reference to RvW. So, you can imagine my shock when the following words escaped the \\'pitbull\\' lipstick-laden mouth of one Sarah Palin: IFILL: Let me clear something up, Sen. McCain has said he supports caps on carbon emissions. Sen. Obama has said he supports clean coal technology, which I don\\'t believe you\\'ve always supported. BIDEN: I have always supported it. That\\'s a fact. IFILL: Well, clear it up for us, both of you, and start with Gov. Palin. PALIN: Yes, Sen. McCain does support this.

Biden, you\\'ve said no to everything in trying to find a domestic solution to the energy crisis that we\\'re in. You even called drilling -- safe, environmentally-friendly drilling offshore as raping the outer continental shelf. Maybe I was the only one who noticed this.

It\\'s entirely possible that Obama and/or Biden did make such a reference to offshore drilling at some point or another...although (Kossack) Ash Meerstrand just posted a diary in which it looks like there\\'s some question as to whether either of them ever even made such a statement. If they didn\\'t, it\\'s even more creepy. That\\'s not the point. The point is that throughout the ENTIRE debate, in a full 90 minutes of discussion, the term \"rape\" was only mentioned ONE time in any context at all--and who was the one who had that particular term on her mind? Sarah Palin. And she even did so immediately after chiding Biden about the \"correct\" wording of the double-entendre \"drill baby drill\" chant.

Tomorrow House Judiciary Committee will meet and take citizen testimony on the nomination of Wayne Anthony Ross to be our next Attorney General. Leah Burton is on with CC, sharing her testimony regarding Wayne Anthony Ross. She is a former citizen lobbyist who worked on behalf of families and children concerning child support, child custody, domestic violence, child abuse and sexual assault. She discusses a meeting of the group DADS (\"Dads Against Discrimination\"), being run by Wayne Anthony Ross, and what she heard. Numerous comments were made that were appalling, not the least of which were remarks by Mr. Ross which included the following; “If a guy can’t rape his wife…who’s he gonna rape?” and “There wouldn’t be an issue with domestic violence if women would learn to keep their mouths shut.”\\n\\nHo.

       " ('As I was driving to work this morning, getting a sense of what I wanted to write about today, I remembered an old quote from my revolutionary days back in the mid 80’s. It was one of my favorites, and it always brought me closer to my goals when I took it to heart:\\n\\n“Act as if the revolution already happened.”\\n\\nThe crazy thing? I could not find it on Google. I was shocked, dismayed, and further convinced that extended experimentation with recreational flora causes permanent memory fog. But I know it was real. And I know it works.\\n\\nThe movement that I was part of has come to be known as “Zine culture” and it revolved around punk rock music and the copy machine. The branch that really floated my boat was called “Mail Art”. There were very distinct similarities to the revolutionary fervor that has exploded into current American collective consciousness with the spectacular success of the Bernie Sanders campaign. Lemme list that.\\n\\n1. We hated money. Any band that signed to a major label was corrupt and contemptible. Real music was made in a garage, for its own sake. I remember one girl told Michael Stipe after an early REM show: “You are getting too popular! I am not going to be able to like you anymore!!!” That sentiment was most hilariously trumpeted by Kurt Cobain when he wore a shirt that said “Corporate magazines still suck.” while milking the rewards of being on the cover of a corporate magazine.\\n\\nSell the kids for food.\\n\\n2. We thought that pure art came from a different source than anything done for commerce. With Mail Art, we created masterpieces and gave them away for free. There was a vast global network of high quality stuff exchanged for no other reason than to create a revolution. Of course it didn’t hurt that we got a little famous here and there. I ended up being included in the final Whole Earth Catalog and solicited for review by Harpers along the way. Those were very good times.\\n\\n3. We wanted to overthrow the establishment. In this case, we wanted to cut the reigns of the corporate entertainment industry and put a chariot in every garage. We wanted each individual in the world to have the power to create their own music or magazine for free and we wanted them to be able to share it with millions of people. It was often called the “self-publishing” revolution.\\n\\n4. We were up against a system that was very difficult to beat. We had no computers, we had to communicate with marks on paper. We distributed in person at punk rock shows, at local record stores, or through the U.S. mail. Snail mail. Music was not digital, only vinyl records or cassette tapes. We wrote our manifestos by hand, or click clack with a typewriter.\\n\\nLong story short, we did it. We changed the world. Our goals were met and exceeded. Human life as we know it was expanded beyond our wildest dreams. Within the next decade, our grassroots push to topple the mechanism of the mighty entertainment/broadcasting/publishing complex was done. We were breaking down walls that had stood since the invention of the printing press. The internet was born from the sweat of our brows and the saliva on the back of our postage stamps. Before we knew it, the revolution already happened.\\n\\nHere is why I am writing about that here, today. Personally, I have total confidence in Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. I see the future in my mind’s eye, and my heart feels a glow that is even brighter than the one that filled it when Barack Obama took that stage on November 4, 2008. We are heading toward a special moment in American history with a special team of players. They are going to work very well together.\\n\\nI know it seems nearly impossible to reconcile the venom and vigor of the recent heated horse race. I know that both sides have been equally egging each other into hurt feelings and foot-stamping pronouncements of eternal evil that can never be accepted. Yet I know that this revolution has already happened. I know they will embrace and unite and lead us into a glorious future.\\n\\nTeamwork for the win.\\n\\nSure, even the most hopeful optimistic positive thinking new age crystal wearing daisy tea drinker will have at least a little speech go through their head saying that I may be wrong on this. But this is the way it works. You fake it until you make it. You create a path of less resistance for your revolution by creating the confidence inside you. Like attracts like, love attracts love, and success attracts success. This is the way it works.\\n\\nI am not simple minded enough to be suggesting that all of the issues that are part of Bernie Sanders’ revolution will come true in 8 years, but I bet things will be much better after Hillary gets done with her presidency. I know for sure that she will help to build the Supreme Court that is absolutely necessary for the destruction of Citizens United. That is a goal that can be focused on, that is part of a concession prize that should be acceptable.\\n\\nBernie and his supporters will be very pleased to embrace the progress that America will achieve while Hillary Clinton is President of the United States. This is not a one-issue revolution and nothing happens by itself in a vacuum. Everyone who values justice and humanity will come together to help eliminate inequality in all its forms. We will fight side by side against poverty, racism, gender bias, LGBT discrimination, campaign finance insanity, domestic violence, health care, and gun control. I probably missed a few, and as a teacher I left out education reform for good luck. I have no doubt, whatsoever, that the issues we care about will be in much better shape by the time 2024 rolls around.\\n\\nTherefore, I have a lot of work to do. Acting as if the revolution already happened is not an excuse to sit on your ass and wait for it to come true. It creates a path of less resistance, but in this case the resistance is massive and the work will be hard. We need to let go of the bad feelings from the primary. We need to unite and elect a Democrat as president. We need to phonebank and canvas and donate and talk face-to-face with everyone we can. We need to get both the House and the Senate back. That is not easy, and it will not be quick. But it will be done.\\n\\nHow, you ask, do we heal and unite? That calls forth a quote that I actually can find on Google. From Shakespeare in Love, of course.',\n",

His DoubleSpeak for asking Steve Pestka and Trevor Thomas not to talk about each other’s record is “Clean and Fair Campaign Agreement.”\\n\\nI write today to ask you both to put [commitments to focus on Justin Amash] in writing by signing and abiding by the enclosed “Clean and Fair Democratic Primary Campaign Agreement.”\\n\\nOne of the clauses in the proposed agreement is:\\n\\nTo avoid attacks on each other’s records and positions by any means, including the media, campaign literature, advertisements, phone calls, mailings, e-mail and speaking engagements. [my emphasis]\\n\\nApparently, the guy running MI’s Democratic Party thinks it’s “fair” to voters to gag all discussion of candidates’ past records. And Steve Pestka, who said he will sign this gag order, agrees!\\n\\nA couple of notes about this proposed gag order.\\n\\nThis is yet another attempt (at least the fifth I have heard or witnessed over the course of this primary) by leaders in the Democratic Party–the same one running against the GOP’s war on women–to silence all discussion of Democrats’ own attacks on women’s autonomy. As far as I’m aware, the only part of Pestka’s record that Thomas has addressed (thus far) was his anti-choice votes while serving in the MI House (indeed, MLive suggests that’s what this is about, as well). Pestka’s campaign, meanwhile, just wanders around saying Thomas has no record (ignoring, of course, Thomas’ role in getting DADT repealed; apparently that doesn’t count).\\n\\nSo this is not about gagging discussion on a policy that Justin Amash would use to bash the Democrat, cause he’s rabidly anti-choice too. Rather, it is about preventing voters from learning what Steve Pestka did the last time voters entrusted him to represent their interests. Mark Brewer’s idea of a “fair” primary is to prevent women from being reminded that Pestka’s record includes a history of legislating against women’s autonomy.\\n\\nApparently, we girls aren’t allowed to hold him accountable for voting against our interests.\\n\\nFurthermore, Brewer built this gag order to be asymmetrical. He didn’t ask Pestka and Thomas to avoid talking about their own records–meaning Pestka would be gagged from mentioning he served in the House and Thomas would be gagged from talking about his role in a key civil rights victory. Rather, this gag order would allow Pestka to continue sending out lit pointing to his time in the State House as one thing that qualifies him to serve in Congress, without allowing Thomas to point out some of the terrible votes he made while there.\\n\\nIf you’re going to gag discussion about past records, Chairman Brewer, you’ve got to gag discussion on both sides!\\n\\nThere’s one more really disgusting aspect to this gag order. Brewer attempts to gag not just the campaign itself, but both his reference to “the media” in the passage above and in the scope of those the candidates would have to gag if they agreed to this–“campaign teams, including staff, surrogates, advisors, consultants, vendors and volunteers”–people far beyond Thomas himself. I’m not formally part of Thomas’ campaign at all (I have donated to his campaign, though), but I am “the media.” I also happen to be a 3rd CD voter who finds the paternalistic way the Democrats have pushed Pestka–“shut up girls! don’t talk about his anti-choice record!”–to be profoundly anti-woman. Is Chairman Brewer really proposing that Thomas be fined every time I speak, as a 3rd CD voter and registered Democrat, for the importance of a candidate who fully supports women’s rights?\\n\\nThat’s what the Democratic Party has come to?\\n\\nWho knows. Maybe there’s a bright side to this.

To be honest, I’ve spent most of my career dozing through boring speeches about \"responsibility\" and \"values\" and \"atrocity\" and \"war\" and \"la revolucion\" and public apathy -- bla bla bla, etc. You get it. The other portion of my career has been spent trying to decipher the notes I scribbled while I was asleep.\\n\\nThis election season, I’m chasing John McCain around, trying to soak in his vision for America. If I’m successful, I’ll be able to bottle that Essence Eau d’Vision as neat prose, and hand it to the American People with the label \"JOHN MCCAIN – FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.\"\\n\\nBut there is a problem. You see, John McCain is a maverick. Trying to pin him down is like trying to glue ketchup to a wolverine. He refuses to be confined by the stringent limits of conventional definitions. The Journalist’s mission becomes difficult when it is confronted with the sheer maverickiness of Mr. McCain; But just the sound of the word \"maverick\" as it rolls off my tongue – such a pleasing conglomeration of syllables – makes me forget about my rage at his utter disdain for the fences with which my colleagues and I would seek to contain him. When we \"zig\" by continually mentioning his soldiering history, he \"zags\" by saying that he’s a soldier. It’s like you never know which way this guy is going to swerve.\\n\\nReporting on Mav McCain is like trying to follow a Jelly Belly through a tornado. It’s gonna get away, but if you could just get your hands on it, it would be so, so sweet. Therein lies the appeal of John McCain. If we could just get close enough to him, we’d have a little taste of what it’s like to be an outsider – a Marlon Brando (in The Wild Ones). The flavor of Enigma.\\n\\nThere are those who say, \"Hey guys, John McCain’s no maverick! He’s willingly saddled himself with the NeoCon legacy of the Bush administration! He’s toeing the party line, foolz!\"\\n\\nTo them, I say, \"How many more times do I have to repeat the words \"McCain\" and \"maverick\" before you finally begin to mentally associate them? One thousand? Twelve hundred and fifty-two?\"\\n\\nThis man is the real deal, simply because people use a really cool word to describe him.\\n\\nCome on. Say \"maverick\" out loud, and tell me – honestly – that you don’t want to vote for McCain.\\n\\nYou know what, I think you – yeah, you, reader! – are a bit of a maverick yourself. I see that twinkle in your eye. That little impish \"let’s bomb the shit out of Iran\" smirk tugging at your lips! On a visceral level, you connect with Maverick McCain. He’s like the guy in the leather jacket at the party – with the slick pompadour, rolling his own cigarette. You know you shouldn’t go out with him, but you do anyway , just for the thrill of bucking society with such a devilish rake.\\n\\nHis speaking style draws comparisons to Eugene Debs, in my humble opinion. The way he stirs and foments crowds can only be described as \"toweringly cinematic and ebulliently charismatic.\" Seriously, that’s the ONLY way to describe his public grandeur. And his stance at the podium! Obama may dreamily gaze off into an unseen distance, but John McCain is not content to gaze. He squints into the horizon, straining to anticipate its next move – as if to warn it silently, \"Don’t try anything smart, you sonuvabitch.\"\\n\\nConsider this speech, given last week at a Corn Shucking in Century City, CA:\\n\\n\"My fellow Americans, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. We are indeed driving through a tunnel together. And I am the candidate with Tunnel Vision. So, I am here to tell you that I think \"tunnel-vision\" is a good thing – especially when you’re driving through a tunnel. In a tunnel, \"Panoramic Vision\" is unnecessary, and would be a shameful waste of government resources. Conventional Wisdom tells us, \"Speak softly, and carry a big stick.\" But I say, \"Speak clearly and loudly, especially if you’re carrying a big stick, because I won’t freaking be able to hear you otherwise – and I would be pretty interested in knowing whether or not you have a big stick.\" I don’t want to live in a country where people are sneaking around with big sticks. I put the question to you, America: Is that wise?\"\\n\\nOf course, panty-waisted liberal Amerika has no appreciation for the rugged maverick, refusing to consider his outrageous and innovative approach to governance.\\n\\nJoel Klein was at the Corn Shucking with me, and his report of McCain’s words typifies the Left’s bias against McCain. It doesn\\'t even resemble the speech I heard.\\n\\n\"You young people with your new technology – iPods, fire. You don’t know the danger. Taking your iFire or whatever and burning up flags with it!

One of these may have appeared in the much discussed two state solution and the UN application of the Palestinian authority.\\n\\nA document in the nature of a legal opinion as reported in Ma\\'an today raises questions of a legal nature about consequences to Palestinians of the September PA application to the UN. Here is the Ma\\'an article describing the contents of the opinion., no link to an actual copy having been posted with the article.\\n\\nThe seven page opinion, by \"Guy Goodwin-Gill, a professor of public international law at Oxford University and a member of the team that won the 2004 non-binding judgement by the International Court of Justice that the route of Israel\\'s wall was illegal,\" reportedly considers a number of consequences which those here interested in a two or more state solution may well wish to consider, given the possible legal consequences of doing so.\\n\\nAmong the questions raised by the opinion, according to Ma\\'an, is the legal relationship of PA to PLO and the Palestinian National Council, and whether the statehood application of PA might have an adverse effect upon refugees whose representation in UN legal terms is granted not to PA but to PLO, and for whom PA may not in the context of a state thereafter have the ability to act.\\n\\nAccording to the article, part of the application presupposes that PA will replace PLO in the status at the UN that PLO presently legally enjoys, and PLO would have no further voice. PLO is authorized to act for all Palestinians, including refugees. The apparent assumption of the opinion is that a mere state would not succeed to all of those, given the nature of a state versus the status PLO has. The principal difference appears to be refugees, on a practical basis.\\n\\nRefugees are represented at present by PLO, the sole entity recognized to speak for the whole of the Palestinian people, according to the article, and PA as a state would only have authority to speak for those found within such state. All of the questions concerning refugees not found in the PA state, including the much discussed right of compensation or return might if this goes forward, be forced into a sort of limbo, with no remaining authorized voice to speak for them.\\n\\nThis may perhaps IMO but not also in the article also impact upon the legal status of Gaza and the ability of PA to act with respect to it, given the want of control and authority of PA in Gaza and the elected status of Hamas there, possibly legally more analogous to PA itself than PA might like.\\n\\nAnother question raised is whether the whole of the Palestinian people must be consenting to do this, which includes refugees and Gaza. A third question in the article relates to the relationship of PLO to PA, in that according to the article PLO is the parent and PA is a limited administrative entity with limited jurisdiction and powers, rather than an autonomous and independent one, which may in fact not have the powers to speak that PLO and PNC would.\\n\\nThe bottom line of the Ma\\'an article is a question as to whether, given the legal matters opined on by Professor Goodwin-Gill, the successful UN application of PA might have adverse consequences which must be considered before action is taken and rights are lost under international law, especially for refugees.\\n\\nThese are issues which should be considered and discussed here, and any available supplements to the Ma\\'an article provided, given that I at least have not seen any of these problems considered here, and our working assumption has been that the existing if stalemated negotiations would encompass all problems beteen the two peoples.\\n\\nI do not claim expertise in these international law issues, but recognize an issue which must be brought forward and considered, even if my only contribution is to type. I am hopeful that some here may know much more about this and come forward, because the consequences of doing something that disenfranchises refugees may be so severe.\\n\\nUsual rules.

The name “Gemayel” brings back memories.\\n\\nLebanon’s Gemayel Family has its own Wikipedia page, with eleven members of the family having individual Wiki pages.\\n\\nIf you followed Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and America’s subsequent misadventure in Lebanon, you’ll remember hearing the name Gemayel.\\n\\nAfter visiting the Berlin Olympics in 1936, Pierre Gemayel founded Lebanon’s fascist-oriented, pro-Western Phalange Party.\\n\\nSheik Pierre’s son Bashir Gemayel was the most ferocious Christian warlord of Lebanon’s civil war that began in 1975. (Above is Geraldo Rivera’s 1982 interview with Bashir.) It should be kept in mind that much of Bashir’s violence was devoted less to fighting Muslims than to making the Gemayels supreme over the other Christian warlord clans, such as the Chamouns.\\n\\n(One of my readers once worked for the State Department and was in charge of babysitting a young member of one of these elite Christian clans eventually overwhelmed by the Gemayels. [I think he was a Chamoun, but my recollection could be faulty.] To pass the time, my reader took the young Lebanese to see The Godfather. His charge was shaken by the movie, saying afterwards: “That’s exactly like my family.” But, as it turned out, they weren’t quite Corleoney enough to stop the rise of the Gemayels.)\\n\\nAnd for 22 days in 1982, Bashir was President-elect of Lebanon, with the backing of the Reagan and Begin-Sharon governments.\\n\\nTime Magazine wrote:\\n\\nGemayel: Ruthless Idealist\\n\\nMonday, Sept. 06, 1982 Liberator. Warlord. Patriot. Power-mad. Those are some of the terms that Bashir Gemayel’s deeply riven countrymen have used to describe their President-elect during his years as a leader of the Christian militia forces. Part political idealist and part storm trooper, Gemayel, 34, has shown he will use whatever means necessary to achieve his nationalist goals.\\n\\nBut on September 14th, 1982, Bashir was blown up (apparently by a rival Christian).\\n\\nThe headline on his obituary in the NYT read:\\n\\nThe notorious massacres in the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon were carried out by Bashir’s Phalangists (apparently with Israeli approval) two days after his murder.\\n\\nBashir’s brother Amine Gemayel took Bashir’s place and served from 1982-1988 as president of Lebanon.\\n\\nAmine’s son Pierre was assassinated in 2006.\\n\\nThree sources I’ve found say the late Senora Slim was the niece of Bashir and Amine Gemayel (which would make her the granddaughter of Pierre Gemayel), while another describes her as their cousin. (Or the genealogical relationship could be more distant: people often collapse relationships when recounting them.)\\n\\nIn summary, I’ve been reading up now and then about Carlos Slim for about eight years now, but until today I’d never heard that his wife was a member of the clan that was in the news practically every single day in 1982.\\n\\nIt probably wouldn’t be good for business for Slim to broadcast that fact. The Gemayels had enemies. On the other hand, important people who would be reassured by this Arab entrepreneur’s ties via his in-laws to, say, Ariel Sharon could be apprised of them personally.\\n\\nI’m starting to imagine that, with that kind of ancestry, Carlos and Soumaya’s six children will remain a dynastic force even after their parents are gone.',\n",

There are many different things that we can do to move forward on health care, but we\\'re not making any of those decisions now.\"\\n\\nBipartisanship obligations only apply to Democrats apparently.\\n\\nTherefore, in the interests of bipartisanship and the media’s distorted sense of fairness, Democrats allowed Senator Brown to be sworn in before passing the bill. Democrats surrendered their ability to do the most good for sick Americans and allowed Republicans to sabotage parts of the ACA with a filibuster—all in the hope that the media and moderate Republican politicians and voters would reward fairness and decency. Instead, Republicans lied about Obamacare for seven years straight, and the media let them do it. Democrats received no political benefit from surrendering their power. In fact, surrendering their power hurt Democrats. Democrats got obliterated in 2010 because they failed to use their historic power to help those who elected them.

But I acknowledge that behavior such as that cited by Rosemond does occur, although I might question how widespread it is, or if it is significantly more disruptive than that I have seen from adults in similar settings. Please remember this last point.\\n\\nThe article cites surveys from Public Agenda, in which in 2002 only 9% thought children were publicly respectful towards adults and in 2004 one in 3 teachers considered leaving the profession or knew colleagues who had left because of the behavior of children. My immediate reaction is that I have seen a significant number of adults who have no memories of what it is to be a child, who act disrespectfully towards children and then are shocked when the behavior is emulated and redirected at them. I also note a significant albeit relatively small minority of those I have seen entering teaching who really do not know how to work with young children or adolescents (depending on grade level) and who blame the children for their inability to maintain a positive learning environment - their sole management style is to threaten, scream, and complain. They make get conformity to their demands, but it will be sullen at best, and undercut as soon as they turn their backs. I don\\'t care how well they know their subjects or how well they score on teacher tests, these people do not belong in classrooms, and I really don\\'t care for their opinions about the behavior of children. But for now, I will grant that there are disruptive and rude children, and let\\'s move on.\\n\\nAfter citing of all people Madonna, the article moves through the paragraph I first cited, where the question is whether the behavior is natural or shaped by society. The very next graf may provide a clue, and please note what I have placed in bold:\\n\\n\\n\\nBut what seems to have changed recently, according to childrearing experts, is parental behavior - particularly among the most status-conscious and ambitious - along with the kinds of behavior parents expect from their kids. The pressure to do well is up. The demand to do good is down, way down, particularly if it\\'s the kind of do-gooding that doesn\\'t show up on a college application.\\n\\nThe article goes on to cite how the expectations of children\\'s behavior has changed. That is,\\n\\n\\n\\nparenting was largely about training children to take their proper place in their community, which, in large measure, meant learning to play by the rules and cooperate\\n\\nConduct was a window into one\\'s character, and there were certain fairly universal expectations.\\n\\n\\n\\nRude behavior, particularly toward adults, was something for which children had to be chastised, even punished.\\n\\nparents might still\\n\\n\\n\\nlike their children to be polite, considerate and well behaved. But they\\'re too tired, worn down by work and personally needy to take up the task of teaching them proper behavior at home.\\n\\n\"We use kids like Prozac,\" he said. \"People don\\'t necessarily feel great about their spouse or their job but the kids are the bright spot in their day. They don\\'t want to muck up that one moment by getting yelled at. They don\\'t want to hurt. They don\\'t want to feel bad. They want to get satisfaction from their kids. They\\'re so precious to us - maybe more than to any generation previously. What gets thrown out the window is limits. It\\'s a lot easier to pick their towel up off the floor than to get them away from the PlayStation to do it.\"\\n\\nHere a direct quote from the Harvard child psychologist who offered the last observation might be pertinent:\\n\\nBut the real issue is that parenting today focuses on training kids to be competitive - in the classroom and on the athletic fields,\\n\\n\\n\\nand the kinds of attributes they need to be competitive are precisely those that help break down society\\'s civility.\\n\\nWarner continues with a number of observations from Kindlon, including that the emphasis of success values achievement over people, kids doing so much additional schoolwork that they don\\'t do chores, and other adults not getting involved:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Nobody feels entitled to discipline other people\\'s kids anymore,\" Dr. Kindlon said. \"They don\\'t feel they have the right if they see a kid doing something wrong to step in.\"\\n\\nHere Warner again cites the data from Public Agenda in 2004, that\\n\\nNearly 8 in 10 teachers . . . said their students were quick to remind them that they had rights or that their parents could sue if they were too harshly disciplined. More than half said they ended up being soft on discipline \"because they can\\'t count on parents or schools to support them.\"\\n\\nI have to interject at that this point that my own experience does not support this. I have never been undercut on discipline by my school administrators, even in the one case that went all the way to the superintendent. I have encountered what we call \"red flag parents\" but I have never allowed that to undercut the application of appropriate discipline. I do, however, have to keep scrupulous records, and I make sure to be proactive, both in communicating with parents and in informing administrators of possible difficult situations. But I acknowledge that I am in a far more fortunate situation than are many teachers around the country, and I make no pretense at generalizing from my own anecdotal experience.\\n\\nThe piece I am citing raises some real questions. I will just offer several of what I think are the most appropriate points:\\n\\n\"We always want to blame the kids, but if there\\'s something wrong with their incivility, it\\'s the way their parents model for them.\"\\n\\nThere\\'s also the chance . . . that when children are rude, obnoxious and outrageously behaved, they\\'re trying to tell parents something - something they\\'ve got to shout in order for them to hear.\\n\\n\"These kids are so extremely stressed from the academic load they\\'re carrying \"\\n\\n\"They have no kid space.\"\\n\\n... parental over-involvement in their children\\'s lives today often hides a very basic kind of indifference to their children\\'s real need, simply to be kids.\\n\\nLet me also offer the final two grafs:\\n\\n\\n\\nIf stress and strain, self-centeredness and competition are the pathogens underlying the rash of rudeness perceived to be endemic among children in America today, then the cure, some experts said, has to be systemic and not topical. Stop blaming the children, they said. Stop focusing on the surface level of behavior and start curing instead the social, educational and parental ills that feed it. This may mean less \"quality\" time with children and more time getting them to do things they don\\'t want to do, like sitting for meals, making polite conversation and - Madonna was right - picking their clothes up off the floor.\\n\\nIn the various threads on education, we always see people talking about behavior. Some commentors will complain about the kids, some will complain about the parents. There is, from my perspective, some validity to both sets of complaints.\\n\\nI am not a parent (except of 5 rescued cats, one of whom is a real behavior problem, but we have no intention of giving him up, any more than most parents would give up a misbehaving child). Thus you may choose to discount the words I have to offer about parenting. I do think parents are a major part of the problem, but that is because I think the pressures they experience from today\\'s society contribute greatly to the kinds family structures and pressures that lead to what I consider aberrant behavior on the part of their children -- that is aberrant, because it is not ultimately productive for society. And here I focus most of all on the loss of kid time.\\n\\nI am by choice a professional educator. I am also by choice one who has jumped into the fray of educational policy debate. I read extensively, I think about it a great deal, and I impose my viewpoints through postings in the blogosphere. And I am increasingly coming to the viewpoint that our focus on what is \"wrong\" with schools, teachers, etc., entirely misses the point.\\n\\nI have often said that we need a serious debate about the purposes of schools and education. I till believe that is true.\\n\\nBut that debate can be meaningful only if it occurs within the framework of a larger debate, about the shape and nature of American society.\\n\\nAnd perhaps this is why I et so upset at the rhetoric on why our schools are failing, because America is not \"competitive\" with other nations, or our test scores are lower, or our test scores are decreasing, or we don\\'t produce as many engineers as China or India (countries with many times our population, but never mind). It is the entire framing of the discussion in competitive terms.\\n\\nNow don\\'t misunderstand. I coach soccer. I am very proud of the fact that in my years as a junior varsity coach I have never had a losing season. This year we were 8-1-1, outscoring our opponents 21-7. It is not the winning record per se that please me, but the improvement in skill and teamwork that my guys develop over the several months we were together. I started with a group of small, relatively inexperienced players, and we defeated several teams larger, faster, and individually more skilled than we were, because we learned how to work together. And I think at least part of the reason we were able to do that is because I gave them the opportunity to organize part of how we practiced, chances to do free scrimmages (where i said nothing).\\n\\nI remember growing up how much of what I learned about sports and about teamwork came from informal games, not from the organized leagues.\\n\\nI also remember how much of my passion for certain kinds of learning came because I was allowed to explore on my own.\\n\\nAnd I see very little opportunity for most of the children I now teach to have similar experiences, and that scares me on their behalf.\\n\\nI accept that we see a great deal of rude and/or inappropriate behavior among our young people. I do not think it is any worse than the behavior they see modeled by adults, and I do not mean just their parents. I remember Conservatives screaming about how Clinton\\'s behavior with respect to Monica Lewinsky set a horrible role model for our children. I was teaching 9th graders then, and their overwhelming reaction was that the response of most adults was hypocritical, hat none of them particularly modeled their behavior, sexually or otherwise, on what any politician did. They did, however, often raise concerns about the lack of comity they saw displayed in political exchanges, how people were willing to do anything for the sake of a political victory. Our children were watching, but as often happens, the lessons they learned may not have those in the official curriculum.\\n\\nIf we place so much emphasis on achievement and ranking and success and do not also include emphasis on things like sportsmanship, civility, common courtesy, then we should not be surprised at the behavior we encounter in our young people. And I do not think we should blame them.\\n\\nAnd if it is ourselves and our society that bares the greater responsibility, why then are the only correctives we take punitive to our children? What will be the lessons they learn from that?\\n\\nFor myself, even as I am a demanding teacher, the most important thing I can give my students is that we must live in a world in which respect and courtesy matter. I have no rules posted in my class, none of this \"break this rule and here\\'s the consequence.\" I do have three questions, applicable to all including me, that we need to ask. The first, and most important, is to ask if my words and actions demonstrate respect for myself and towards others.\\n\\nI would argue that if we expect our children to act respectfully towards each other and towards adults, then we adults - both those of us who regularly interact with the young people and those in leadership positions in society - need to tart modeling such behavior by acting with respect towards them, and towards each other.\\n\\nThe behavior of our children could use improvement. But that will not occur in an environment where our political and civil discourse is anything but civil, full of invective, denigration, and attack. it that is what we value, that and \"success\" over anything else, then it is foolish to waste any time wondering why we encounter the behavior of young people about which we complain.\\n\\nBy the way, it has been my experience that those adults who treat students with respect, who take the time to explain the reasons for the actions they make, who are willing to acknowledge to students when they (the adults) are wrong and apologize for their own shortcoming, these adults have far fewer behavior problems among their students. And unless and until the shape of our schools is changed so that it demonstrates a greater degree of respect towards our students, we are likely to continue to have concerns about the behavior there, or that our children demonstrate in society as a whole.\\n\\nAre children savages? They are clearly not little adults, except in one way. They are absolutely accurate mirrors on our society, their behavior being a right-on reflection of those values we adults choose to hold most dear, as we inevitably demonstrate in our own words and actions. So if our children\\'s behavior is unacceptable, the answer is not to blame them, or to seek punitive corrective action aimed at them. The real answer is to look at ourselves, at the increasing coarseness of much of our society, and to attempt rectification at that level. If we continue with a \"do as I say not as a I do\" approach we are ot only kidding ourselves about how effective that can be, we do our children - and hence the future of this nation -- a grave disservice.',\n",

       " ('As is often the case, I opened the Monday newspaper curious to find out how the weekend had gone at the movies. The headline read, “‘Ghostbusters’ Is No. 2 Behind ‘Secret Life of Pets.’” That meant Universal Studios’ animated film had again been the big winner, taking in an estimated $50.6 million for a two-week domestic total of $203.2 million. In the industry, it was feared that China, the world’s number two market and gaining fast, might not let another hit, Ghostbusters, be shown, given its paranormal themes. Still, all in all, it had been an upbeat week for one of the two dominant American product lines that go boom in the night and also have a remarkable grip on their respective global markets. The first of those — think action films, superhero movies, and space operas — comes out of Hollywood and, in multiplexes globally, one thing is guaranteed: you’re not going to get the next Avengerssequel or Fast and Furious 23 from Russia, France, or China. Not surprisingly, since Hollywood rakes in billions of dollars annually from the rest of the planet for entertaining us all, weekly news about its business successes and failures is a regular feature of our world.\\n\\nAnd, oh yes, then there’s that other business, the one that actually makes things that go boom in the night. I’m talking, of course, about the weapons trade. As TomDispatch regular Bill Hartung, author of Prophets of War: Lockheed Martin and the Making of the Military-Industrial Complex, points out today, it has an almost monopolistic grip on its global market and, like Hollywood, regularly has cheery news to offer about the billions of dollars it pulls in from countries at war or fearing future conflicts. In fact, for a business that — bottom line — kills people rather than simply thrilling them with bloody mayhem, it, too, has a remarkably upbeat sense of itself.\\n\\nTake Thomas Kennedy, CEO of Raytheon, a major arms maker, presently cleaning up when, as Defense News reports, it comes to the “missile defense interceptor, as well as air-to-ground missiles and air-to-air combat missiles fired by fighter jets” that it’s selling across the Middle East (and in some cases in Asia, too). The company is projecting a revenue rise of 3%-5% this year and, according to Defense One, “When investors visiting Raytheon’s factories ask ‘How’s business?’ Kennedy tends to respond like this: ‘Did you notice you couldn’t get a parking space?… ‘Where else can you find a factory in America that you can’t get a parking space?’”\\n\\nORDER IT NOW\\n\\nSo here’s the puzzle: two major industries with certain similarities grip their global markets in similarly overwhelming ways. One is the focus of almost constant reportage and attention, the other largely avoids notice in our world. Why is that? Fortunately, TomDispatch can call on Hartung’s expertise when it comes to the remarkably little known “success” story of America’s weapons makers to offer the sort of picture of one of this country’s stellar industries that you won’t find anywhere else.',\n",

To demonstrate how grown up I\\'ve become, what follows is some exceedingly dispassionate and mature speculation regarding how on earth the BYU Management Society could possibly deem OSC deserving of this honor (with bonus Executive Summary gravitas courtesy of the outline format).\\n\\nI.

I changed my mind completely. Now I have a deep aversion to bigotry-centered populist demagogues -- one thinks, for instance, of the leaders of the anti-amnesty movement.

I will act to destroy that government and bring it down, so it can be replaced with a government that will respect and support marriage, and help me raise my children in a society where they will expect to marry in their turn. Biological imperatives trump laws. American government cannot fight against marriage and hope to endure. If the Constitution is defined in such a way as to destroy the privileged position of marriage, it is that insane Constitution, not marriage, that will die. -- Orson Scott Card\\n\\nV.

       " ('As more Democrats have started to question why former Attorney General Loretta Lynch was never investigated for obstruction following a suspicious meeting with former President Bill Clinton, it appears the Senate Judiciary Committee has finally decided to act.\\n\\nThe Washington Times reported Friday that the committee has launched a formal investigation into Lynch’s attempts to shape the FBI’s probe into Hillary Clinton, and whether she mishandled classified information on her private email server.\\n\\nAccording to the Times, the investigation has bipartisan support.\\n\\n“Sen. Charles E. Grassley, chairman of the committee, said the investigation is bipartisan. The letter to Ms. Lynch is signed by ranking Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein and also by Sens. Lindsey Graham and Sheldon Whitehouse, the chairman and ranking member of the key investigative subcommittee.” “Letters also went to Clinton campaign staffer Amanda Renteria and Leonard Benardo and Gail Scovell at the Open Society Foundations. Mr. Benardo was reportedly on an email chain from the then-head of the Democratic National Committee suggesting Ms. Lynch had given assurances to Ms. Renteria, the campaign staffer, that the Clinton probe wouldn’t “go too far.\"\\n\\nDuring testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, former FBI Director James Comey said his suspicions about Lynch’s cozy relationship with the Clintons prompted him to unilaterally announce the close of the Clinton investigation last summer. According to Comey, Lynch leaned on him to soften his language when discussing the investigation, asking him to refer to the probe as a “matter,” mirror language used by the campaign, instead of as “an investigation.”\\n\\nComey also said the suspicious meeting between Clinton and Lynch raised questions about her objectivity that could’ve compromised the bureau’s integrity.\\n\\nLANKFORD: Then you made a comment earlier a the attorney general, the previous attorney general asking you about the investigation on the Clinton e-mails saying you were asked to not call it an investigation anymore. But call it a matter. You said that confused you. You can give us additional details on that? COMEY: Well, it concerned me because we were at the point where we refused to confirm the existence as we typically do of an investigation for months. And was getting to a place where that looked silly because the campaigns we\\'re talking about interacting with the FBI in the course of our work. The Clinton campaign at the time was using all kinds of euphemisms, security matters, things like that for what was going on. We were getting to a place where the attorney general and I were both going to testify and talk publicly about it I wanted to know was she going to authorize us to confirm we have an investigation. She said yes, don\\'t call it that, call it a matter. I said why would I do that? She said, just call it a matter. You look back in hindsight, if I looked back and said this isn\\'t a hill worth dying on so I just said the press is going to completely ignore it. That\\'s what happened when I said we opened a matter. They all reported the FBI has an investigation open. So that concerned me because that language tracked the way the campaign was talking about the FBI\\'s work and that\\'s concerning. LANKFORD: You gave impression that the campaign was somehow using the language as the FBI because you were handed the campaign language? COMEY: I don\\'t know whether it was intentional or not but it gave the impression that the attorney general was looking to align the way we talked about our work with the way it was describing that. It was inaccurate. We had an investigation open for the federal bureau of investigation, we had an investigation open at the time. That gave me a queasy feeling.\\n\\nSo who was obstructing or trying to interfere there?\\n\\nComey said that this troubled him greatly and convinced him, “I have to step away from the department if we’re too close this case credibly.”\\n\\nAs former Speaker Newt Gingrich noted earlier this week, even California Sen. Dianne Feinstein – the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee – had begun to wonder aloud why Lynch was being investigated. Gingrich said the absence of an investigation is a sign of Republican weakness.\\n\\n“What’s amazing to me about the Republican passivity here is that Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the intelligence committee, said last week after Comey’s testimony ‘you know we really have to look into exactly what’s going on with Loretta lynch and with president Obama.\\' Now I was waiting for one of the intel chairmen in the House and Senate to get up and say they’re opening a new investigation into exactly what Loretta lynch said to Comey.”\\n\\nNow we wait to see if the house and, more importantly, the DOJ follow suit.',\n",

       " (\"As much as one loves Bob Dylan, it is always best to resist the temptation to write about him. He is a slippery fish, who is routinely put-off by the industrial-level attempts to access his soul through the interpretation of his lyrics. And if Dylan makes albums—at the rate of almost one a year—as an excuse for introspection, then much of what we find obscure in his catalog is by definition intelligible only to him.\\n\\nThis leaves Dylan theorists with only his public persona to base their theories on, which allows the song and dance man ample opportunity to do the one thing he seems to love best: dissemble. Here is a recent Dylan comment on the media:\\n\\nI realized at the time that the press, the media, they're not the judge—God's the judge. The only person you have to think about lying twice to is either yourself or to God. The press isn't either of them. And I just figured they're irrelevant.\\n\\nIf we cannot get to Dylan through his lyrics, or through his public statements, what is left? Answer: his endorsement deals.\\n\\nEndorsements are a wonderful interpretive lens because even the most asinine decision to do a commercial tells us a little something about the person. For instance, what can we infer about Michael Jordan through his Hanes partnership? Does he simply love underwear? Maybe he believes in the nobility of the Hanes brand? Or maybe he wants a big check. Bags of money would also explain commercial engagement with McDonald’s—precisely the kind of food you can bet was never on Jordan’s training table. It would also explain his deal with Coke; his endorsement of re-usable alkaline batteries; ballpark hotdogs; and sneakers made by the best child labor outsourcing can buy! Put it all together and you begin to get a sense of what the man values, or should I say value$.\\n\\nSo, what do Dylan’s commercials reflect?\\n\\nSometimes, Dylan does not appear in the commercial, choosing merely to license his song, like in this Chobani bit featuring a rampaging bear on a maniacal quest for yogurt; the background tune: Dylan’s “I Want You.” Other times, a montage of various, younger Dylan’s appear, like his split-screen appearance with Will.i.am in a Pepsi commercial. When he is not eating yogurt and sipping Pepsi, or listening to his iPod, Dylan enjoys taking a drive in his Cadillac…until he gets bored and decides to switch to Chrysler because, hey, “things have changed!” Where is America’s finest poet off to in such a hurry? A Victoria’s Secret commercial shoot, of course—and what red-blooded American wants to keep the models waiting?\\n\\nAll of these ads spur a question: Where has the usual Dylan disdain gone? There was no wink or nod or anything one might expect from the normally reclusive and ornery singer. Maybe Columbia Records demanded some kind of recompense for allowing the production of Christmas in the Heart? That, or the PR types knew better than to trust Dylan with any artistic input in his advertisements.\\n\\nAnd then I spotted his most recent commercial for IBM.\\n\\n(For those who can't watch, the commercial proceeds as follows: Dylan walks into view and sits on a couch before a computer who then begins to speak. “Watson,” IBM’s natural language processing machine, informs Dylan that, in an effort to improve his language skills he has read all of the singer’s lyrics. He reports that his analysis shows Dylan’s major themes are that “time passes” and “love fades.” After Watson confesses he has never known love, Dylan offers they write a song together, to which Watson responds with some of his own lyrics: “do be bop be bop a doo.” With that, Dylan walks away, guitar in hand, while the words “IBM Watson thinks with us to outthink the limits of creativity” appear on the screen.)\\n\\nJust how Watson, hand-in-hand with Dylan, will engage in “outthinking the limits of creativity” is impossible to tell. It is impossible, because “outsmarting the limits of creativity” is a meaningless statement, which brings me to my theory. What is at play here is the reappearance of that old Dylan mischievousness, this time at the expense of the very company he is ostensibly endorsing. IBM, in an attempt to promote a machine that will seamlessly interface with human beings, comes off as having created a tone-deaf bot that, when confronted with a paragon of human creativity, is literally abandoned. We don’t know where Dylan rambled off to, but we do know that the song with Watson does not get written. If this is a little joke Dylan is making about the limits of human ability to interact in a meaningful way with modern technology despite the best packaging efforts of Silicon Valley, then I have only one thing to say: Welcome back, Bob.\",\n",

       " ('As news on the Great Cyprus Bank Robbery keep getting worse, the latest being the country’s corrupt finance minister Michael Sarris saying that as much as 80% of “large” bank deposits can be confiscated, Americans should be on the alert to copycat moves by our feral government and bankers. All the more because the American Left are applauding the theft of Cypriots’ bank savings.\\n\\nTyler Durden of ZeroHedge warns us that when bankrupt insolvent governments “run out of fingers to plug the dikes,” history shows that they fall back on a very limited playbook.\\n\\nSimon Black of Sovereign Man blog has enumerated 8 steps in the playbook of bankrupt governments:\\n\\n1. Direct confiscation: As Cyprus showed us, bankrupt governments are quite happy to plunder people’s bank accounts, especially if it’s a wealthy minority. Aside from bank levies, though, this also includes things like seizing retirement accounts (Argentina), increases in civil asset forfeiture (United States), and gold criminalization.\\n\\n2. Taxes: Just another form of confiscation, taxation plunders the hard work and talent of the citizenry. But thanks to decades of brainwashing, it’s more socially acceptable. We’ve come to regard taxes as a ‘necessary evil,’ not realizing that the country existed for decades, even centuries, without an income tax. Yet when bankrupt governments get desperate enough, they begin imposing new taxes… primarily WEALTH taxes (Argentina) or windfall profits taxes (United States in the 1970s).\\n\\n3. Inflation: This is indirect confiscation– the slow, gradual plundering of people’s savings. Again, governments have been quite successful at inculcating a belief that inflation is also a necessary evil. They’re also adept at fooling people with phony inflation statistics.\\n\\n4. Capital Controls: Governments can, do, and will restrict the free-flow of capital across borders. They’ll prevent you from moving your own money to a safer jurisdiction, forcing you to keep your hard earned savings at home where it can be plundered and devalued. We’re seeing this everywhere in the developed world… from withdrawal limits in Europe to cash-sniffing dogs at border checkpoints. And it certainly doesn’t help when everyone from the IMF to Nobel laureate Paul Krugman argue in favor of Capital Controls.\\n\\n5. Wage and Price controls: When even the lowest common denominator in society realizes that prices are getting higher, governments step in and ‘fix’ things by imposing price controls. Occasionally this also includes wage controls… though wage increases tend to be vastly outpaced by price increases. Of course, as any basic economics textbook can illustrate, price controls never work and typically lead to shortages and massive misallocations.\\n\\n6. Wage and Price controls– on STEROIDS: When the first round of price controls don’t work, the next step is to impose severe penalties for not abiding by the terms. In the days of Diocletian’s Edict on Prices in the 4th century AD, any Roman caught violating the price controls was put to death. In post-revolutionary France, shopkeepers who violated the “Law of Maximum” were fleeced of their private property… and a national spy system was put into place to enforce the measures.\\n\\n7. Increased regulation: Despite being completely broke, governments will dramatically expand their ranks in a last desperate gasp to envelop the problem in sheer size. In the early 1920s, for example, the number of bureaucratic officials in the German Weimar Republic increased 242%, even though the country was flat broke from its World War I reparation payments and hyperinflation episode. The increase in both regulations and government officials criminalizes and/or controls almost every aspect of our existence… from what we can/cannot put in our bodies to how we are allowed to raise our own children.\\n\\n8. War and National Emergency: When all else fails, just invade another country. Pick a fight. Keep people distracted by working them into a frenzy over men in caves… or some completely irrelevant island.\\n\\n~Eowyn\\n\\nAdvertisements',\n",

       " (\"As part of his campaign “law and order” message, Donald Trump repeatedly claimed crime was rising nationwide.\\n\\n“Fact checkers” disputed his assertions, with Politifact notably declaring Trump’s declaration “Pants on fire!” when it released a scathing rebuttal.\\n\\nBut as the year comes to a close and new data becomes available, it appears once again Donald Trump was right.\\n\\nAs reported in the Wall Street Journal, 16 of the 20 largest police departments in the country reported a rise in homicides as of mid-December. The city of Chicago showed an astounding 56 percent increase in murders from 2015.\\n\\nAccording to the Major Cities Chiefs Association, 37 of the 65 largest police departments reported year-over-year increases in homicide rates as of Sept. 30. In context, the findings are even worse, as some of those cities who had decreases in homicides, including Milwaukee, Baltimore and Washington, D.C., are simply recovering from dramatic increases in 2015.\\n\\nThe Journal notes, “In some cities, violent crime increased in the wake of deadly police confrontations with young black men.”\\n\\nThe rising tensions between police and African-American communities has led to what some people call “The Ferguson Effect,” as police feel unable to do their jobs. FBI Director James Comey stated in 2015 police officers were avoiding engagement with communities because they felt “under siege” and did not want to get out of their cars for fear of being targeted by a mob.\\n\\nTheir fears are not unfounded.\\n\\nViolence against police has also increased sharply. Shootings of police officers are up over 70 percent in 2016, and fatal ambushes are up by over 150 percent.\\n\\nJeff Roorda, a retired police officer, former Missouri state representative, and the current business manager for the St. Louis Police Officers Association, is among those who allege the aggression against police is driving an increase in violent crime.\\n\\n“Police are under an unprecedented verbal attack from the mainstream media and politicians as well as an unprecedented physical attack from criminals whose acts of anti-police violence are emboldened by these rhetorical assaults on law enforcement,” he told WND.\\n\\nRoorda, author of “The War On Police: How The Ferguson Effect Is Making America Unsafe,” claims police officers are being lost “in droves” because of the multifaceted “war” being waged against them.\\n\\n“Police departments are dangerously understaffed as a result and recruiting has become every bit as difficult as retention,” he said. “Consequently, the cops who remain on the job are reluctant and outnumbered. See the bloody streets of Chicago if you want to understand better what happens when you make the job of a cop impossible.”\\n\\nRoorda said the media were determined to ignore the rise in crime because the facts didn’t fit the narrative they had manufactured.\\n\\n“The media have been manipulating this myth of racially motivated police brutality since Rodney King,” said Roorda. “The fact that the use of this narrative was thought to damage Mr. Trump by denying the truth of what he said was an added bonus for the media elite.”\\n\\nIt’s never been tougher to be one of the men in blue than it is right now. Get “The War On Police: How the Ferguson Effect Is Making America Unsafe” now at the WND Superstore\\n\\nColin Flaherty, who chronicled black mob violence directed against whites nationwide in his book “White Girl Bleed A Lot,” pinned the blame on the Obama administration for telling criminals, especially African-Americans, they were not responsible for their own criminal behavior.\\n\\n“Instead, black criminals are regarded as victims of white racism,” Flaherty complained. “Telling criminals that crime is not their fault is just about the most dangerous thing a government can do – and the Obama crowd did just that daily.”\\n\\nRev. Jesse Lee Peterson, a WND columnist, civil rights leader, founder of BOND (Brotherhood Organization of a New Destiny) and author of “The Antidote: Healing America From The Poison Of Hate, Blame and Victmhood,” agreed Obama is at least partially to blame.\\n\\n“The anti-police rhetoric and grandstanding coming from Obama and the Department of Justice over the past eight years has caused police to be less pro-active and has emboldened criminals,” the reverend told WND. “Also, the breakdown of the black family and rise in single female-headed households has created a lack of respect for police and authority. The brainwashing of the youth by so-called black leaders and the liberal education system is also fostering an environment where police – especially white officers – are viewed as ‘‘racist.'”\\n\\nAnd as Peterson observed, it is the black community that pays the cost of this “anti-racist” posturing.\\n\\n“Law-abiding blacks are being victimized by the lawlessness that is consuming cities like Chicago, Detroit and Memphis,” Peterson thundered. “The rise in homicides in major cities directly impacts blacks first because this is where the majority of blacks reside. Supporting the police and aggressively going after criminals is going to help decent black Americans.”\\n\\nRoorda agreed anti-police agitation endangers African-Americans even as it claims to speak in the name of “black lives.” He was especially critical of “Black Lives Matter,” which many observers have called a “hate group.”\\n\\n“I don’t want to get the notion that black lives matter confused with the ill-named ‘Black Lives Matter’ movement,” Roorda told WND. “Every day I pinned on my badge as a cop and put myself in harm’s way, I did so because I believed that black lives do matter and I had a sacred duty to protect them. But the organization ‘Black Lives Matter’ endangers the lives of African-Americans. Their hate speech, calls to arms and activities that marginalize law enforcement have resulted in a booming increase in crime. Because blacks are disproportionately the victims of crime, particularly violent crime, BLM places black lives in danger every minute of every day.\\n\\n“Police simply want peace. But peace won’t come until the national dialogue centers on reality. More blacks are dying at the hands of police because more blacks are trying to kill police or engaging in other dangerous behavior that requires police to deploy deadly force. That’s what we need to address.”\\n\\n\\n\\nBoth Peterson and Roorda say the most important thing President-elect Trump can do to stop the violence once he assumes office is simply tell the truth.\\n\\n“Trump should continue supporting police and speaking the truth about the real cause of crime and offer real solutions for inner city problems,” Peterson said. “He should encourage the police to do their jobs and let them know that his administration will not be politicize the judicial process and will support law enforcement.”\\n\\nAnd Roorda argued Trump needs to keep speaking out against the phony media narratives that smear police officers for doing their jobs.\\n\\n“He just needs to be honest,” said Roorda. “All of this trouble started with the soundbite distortions that were fabricated from high-profile police encounters, mantras like, ‘hands up; don’t shoot’ or ‘I can’t breathe’ or ‘rough ride’ that were cut from whole cloth in Ferguson, Staten Island and Baltimore. If this president rejects those lies rather than embrace and perpetuate them as the last president did, it will change the national dialogue.”\\n\\nIt’s never been tougher to be one of the men in blue than it is right now.

       " ('As the Center for Military Readiness (CMR) explains , Carter could only make the change by overruling the best professional advice of the U.S. Marine Corps “in matters involving life, death, and national security,” and “by breaking his own promise” to base his decision on the quality of scientific research behind the military services’ recommendations. The Marine Corps had requested some exceptions to the policy, but Carter declined to honor them. “The important factor in making my decision was to have access to every American who could add strength to the joint force,” he insisted, further stating the decision to do so was based on empirical analysis of the data following a three-year review by all armed services branches.\\n\\nIn a move that reeks of political correctness, Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced Thursday that all combat positions in the U.S. military will now be open to women, with no exceptions. “They’ll be allowed to drive tanks, fire mortars and lead infantry soldiers into combat,” Carter declared. “They’ll be able to serve as Army rangers and green berets, Navy SEALs, Marine Corps infantry, Air Force parajumpers and everything else that was previously open only to men.”\\n\\nIn terms of Combat Performance Readiness, all male units out-performed integrated units in 69 percent of ground combat tasks with the greatest physical discrepancies occurring in “specialties that carried the assault load plus the additional weight of crew-served weapons and ammunition.” Cumulative Impact of Injuries categories revealed women’s disadvantage in upper and lower body strength resulted in higher fatigue levels and greater incidents of over-use injuries, such as stress fractures.\\n\\nIntegrated units were found lacking in three areas. Female Marines demonstrated they were capable of performing physically demanding tasks, but not at levels commensurate with their male counterparts, measured in terms of performance, fatigue, workload, or cohesion. With very few exceptions gender-integrated units also performed at lower levels with respect to time taken to complete tasks, move under loads and achieve timely efforts on targets, when compared with male counterparts. And finally, it was determined that the greater the gender integration, the more these shortfalls were “magnified.”\\n\\nNot exactly. The Marine Corps Test and Evaluation Activity (MCOTEA) report, a 33-page memo with attached documents, was signed by Brig. Gen. George W. Smith, Jr., Director of the Marine Corps Force Innovation Office. It was designed to analyze the collective performances of units because Marines operate as such. Moreover the analysis emphasized the unwavering focus considered the benchmark of achieving the most combat effective force.\\n\\nCMR president Elaine Donnelly disputes that assertion, noting that Carter promised to base his decision on “the analytic underpinnings and the data supporting them.” On that basis, Donnelly added, “Secretary Carter must assign greater weight to Marine Corps empirical evidence than he does to wishful thinking, unsupported speculations, and ‘mitigation myths.’” CMR further explains Task Force tests were created to test the hypothesis that “an integrated unit under gender-neutral standards will perform equally as well as a gender-restricted unit.”\\n\\nYet perhaps the one stat the reveals the political nature of this exercise was an Army Survey taken in 2013 of the service’s nearly 170,000 women: less than 8 percent who responded to that survey wanted a combat job. Moreover, that survey was followed up with a series of questionnaires sent to women on active duty, in the reserves and to Army National Guard members. Again, only 7.5 percent of the 30,000 women who responded indicated their desire to obtain jobs in infantry, armor, artillery and combat engineering.\\n\\nRegardless, the Obama administration is moving forward with the program, getting mixed reviews in the process. “This is a unilateral decision by the secretary of defense for purely political reasons,” said Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA), a member of the Armed Services Committee who served two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. “What is it going to do to our ability to be lethal at the small-unit level? It degrades that ability,” he added. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, (D-NY), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee disagreed. “This will strengthen our armed forces, and it builds on a history of honorable and courageous service by women throughout the military,” she countered. Judy Patterson, CEO of the Service Women’s Action Network was thrilled with Carter’s “momentous decision.” “We salute his leadership on this issue, and look forward to working with him and the service branches to create full combat integration in 2016,” she said.\\n\\nRepublican House and Senate leaders remain skeptical of the decision, and promised they would vigorously oversee the program’s implementation. Former Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford was also believed to be disdainful of the decision. Despite his current position as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he did not appear by Carter’s side when the decision was announced. More than likely that’s because in his prior position as Marine Corps’ commandant, he was the one who requested the exception to placing women in certain Marine roles last September, based on the aforementioned study analyses. Unfortunately Dunford’s supervisor at that time was Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, who expressed his support for gender integration, while trashing the study results as biased. “It started out with a fairly large component of the men thinking this is not a good idea and women will never be able to do this,” Mabus told NPR’s David Greene. “When you start out with that mindset you’re almost presupposing the outcome.”\\n\\nDunford released his own statement last Thursday. “My responsibility is to ensure (Carter’s) decision is properly implemented,” he said. “Moving forward my focus is to lead the full integration of women in a manner that maintains our joint war-fighting capability, ensures the health and welfare of our people, and optimizes how we leverage talent across the Joint Force.”\\n\\nThe military had been given a Dec. 31 deadline to implement the changes, or request a waiver backed by data showing why women would not be capable of performing certain tasks. Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, promised Congress would use the time remaining to review the decision. “Secretary Carter’s decision to open all combat positions to women will have a consequential impact on our service members and our military’s war fighting capabilities,” he stated. “The Congress has an essential constitutional role to make rules for the government and regulation of our nation’s armed forces.”\\n\\nSen Jack Reed (D-RI), the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, stood squarely behind the decision. “Change will not happen overnight,” he said in a statement. “It will likely take some time before women are assigned to certain combat occupations. But going forward, the combat effectiveness of our forces will increase as integrated units are able to take advantage of the very best talent available for military service, without restriction.”\\n\\nPerhaps, but it is far more likely the same incrementalist progressive mindset that had former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey suggesting that “standards too high for women should be questioned” and calling for a “critical mass” of women in Direct Ground Combat (DGC) units, coupled with the\\n\\nObama administration’s promotion of “gender diversity metrics” (read quotas) that could lead to higher-performing personnel being replaced by those meeting minimum standards characterized as “lower but equal,” will ultimately prevail.\\n\\nMedal of Honor winner Dakota Meyer, who served with honor and distinction in Afghanistan to earn the highest award for bravery in the military, was also concerned with the decision. “In my opinion that decision was based on a political push and not a realistic thought-out study,” Meyer said. He noted many women served successfully in Iraq and Afghanistan, but maintained politicians like Carter “aren’t listening to their counterparts in the military,” referring to Carter’s decision to reject the Marines’ request for a waiver.\\n\\nOnly time will tell if this policy is successful, but if there is a defining characteristic of the Obama administration that stands out above all rest, an utter lack of credibility is number one with a bullet. “ISIL will not pose an existential threat to us,” Obama said in CBS interview—taped the same day the atrocity in San Bernardino was unfolding. “They are a dangerous organization like al Qaeda was, but we have hardened our defenses. The American people should feel confident that, you know, we are going to be able to defend ourselves and make sure that, you know, we have a good holiday and go about our lives.”\\n\\nSuch denialism goes hand in hand with progressive attitudes regarding gender integration. The Obama administration pursues diversity while ISIS pursues the destruction of our nation, and Iran pursues a nuclear weapon. And once again, the administration’s timing is impeccable: one day after the deadliest terror attack since 9/11, the president chose to advance his social engineering agenda and degrade the nation’s military preparedness. That’s because progressives would rather protect multiculturalism, diversity and political correctness than the lives of their fellow Americans. Remember that next November.',\n",

Every prophet has realized that most of us want peace at any price as long as the peace is ours and somebody else pays the price.\" As reflected in their rhetoric and actions, JVP wants peace at the expense of Palestinians.\\n\\nThe July 9th statement was authored by JVP Executive Director Rebecca Vilkomerson. In it she claims: \"To end violence - and truly mourn its victims - we must acknowledge, and challenge the root causes beneath it. The occupation, with US military and financial support, is the root cause.\" JVP\\'s position is that \"the occupation\" refers only to territory captured by Israeli forces in the 1967 war.\\n\\nFor nineteen years, from 1948 until 1967, Israel did not control East Jerusalem, Gaza, or the West Bank. So, what then was the \"root cause\" of the assassination of UN envoy Folke Bernadotte by Jewish terrorists, Israel\\'s \"border wars\" in the 1940s and 1950s, the Lavon affair, the Suez crisis, and the 1967 war? Hint: it wasn\\'t \"the occupation\" as JVP defines it.\\n\\nThe root cause of the conflict in Palestine-Israel is the creation and maintenance by force of a Jewish state in a territory with a non-Jewish majority. This resulted in the displacement of what is now more than five million Palestinian refugees from 1948 alone. The only real solution for the conflict will be the dismantling of the Jewish apartheid state and its replacement by one state in all of Palestine with equal rights for all of its citizens and the return of those refugees who chose to return.\\n\\nResponding to criticism of JVP and the assertion that \"You\\'re just whistling past the freshly dug graves if you think the \\'two-state\\' delusion will solve anything\" by a member of Veterans For Peace (VFP), a member of that organization\\'s national board of directors weighed-in. Gordon\\'s (not his real name) comments illuminate the problems within the American peace movement on the subject of Israel.\\n\\nConcerning \"two-state vs. one-state solutions,\" Gordon asserts, that is \"something that has not yet been resolved among Palestinians. That is why VFP calls for Palestinian self-determination.\" In light of my twelve years of experience as a member, VFP hides behind the fig leaf of Palestinian \"self-determination\" to avoid supporting a one-state solution because, collectively, its leaders and members—not all of them, of course—are too afraid, ignorant, unprincipled, or defeated to confront the Left Zionists* in our midst and the larger peace movement.\\n\\nAfter a brief delay, Western supporters of the South African anti-apartheid movement quickly rejected the White apartheid regime\\'s own version of a two-state solution. There was nothing like the dithering we see now in the peace movement concerning Palestine. Justice and peace advocates rapidly coalesced around the idea of one democratic state in South Africa with equality for all of its citizens despite the fact that a significant minority of Black South Africans, led by Buthelezi, accepted a pseudo-statelet offered to them by the apartheid regime.\\n\\nThe idea that \"two-state vs. one-state solutions\" is \"something that has not yet been resolved among Palestinians\" is dubious, at best. There are millions of Palestinians and you will seldom if ever get unanimity in any large population. Nevertheless, all the recent scientific polls of Palestinian public opinion I am aware of demonstrate that a solid majority of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza (WBG) support a one-state solution.\\n\\nA 2008 scientific poll conducted by the Palestine-based Arab World for Research and Development (AWRAD), under the supervision of Colin Irwin, and commissioned by the astroturf OneVoice Movement, which supports a two-state solution, found that the \"final status\" option that WBG Palestinians most strongly support (82%) is \"Historic Palestine – From the Jordanian river to the sea\". A 2010 scientific poll conducted by AWRAD found that 91% of Palestinians in the WBG say that \"historic Palestine—from the Jordan River to the sea—as the national homeland of the Palestinians is essential or desirable\" as the \"final status\" outcome of any peace agreement.† A 2011 scientific poll conducted by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research for the US-based Israel Project found that only 30% of Palestinians in the WBG accept \"permanently a two-state solution with one homeland for the Palestinian people living side-by-side with Israel, a homeland for the Jewish people\" while 66% agreed that the \"real goal ... should be ... one Palestinian state\" in all of Palestine.\\n\\nMore recently, a June 2014 scientific poll of WBG Palestinians conducted by \"a leading Palestinian pollster\" for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy found that \"a clear majority (60% overall, including 55% in the West Bank and 68% in Gaza) say that the five-year goal \\'should be to work toward reclaiming all of historic Palestine, from the river to the sea\\' \" and \"Nearly two-thirds said \\'resistance should continue until all of historic Palestine is liberated.\\' \" Only \"one-third said that a two-state solution \\'should be the end of the conflict.\\' \"\\n\\nThese polling results are remarkable considering the tremendous pressure placed on Palestinians to accept Israel\\'s existence as a Jewish state and the fact that the Palestinian Authority has publicly committed itself to a two-state solution. However, the breadth and depth of Palestinian resistance to accepting Israel\\'s existence is reflected elsewhere. Specifically, the Palestinian National Charter of 1964 clearly says: \"Palestine is an Arab homeland\" and \"Palestine, with its boundaries at the time of the British Mandate, is a indivisible territorial unit\". It also says:\\n\\nThe partitioning of Palestine, which took place in 1947, and the establishment of Israel are illegal and null and void, regardless of the loss of time, because they were contrary to the will of the Palestinian people and its natural right to its homeland, and were in violation of the basic principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations, foremost among which is the right to self-determination. [emphasis added]\\n\\nTo the dismay of many a two-stater the Charter has never been amended to remove its claim on all of Palestine as the Palestinian homeland. Zionists clearly understand that the Charter is an \"accurate reflection of what Palestinians want\" —one state in all of historic Palestine. Generally, the US peace movement is negligently or willfully blind to this or simply too cowardly to reflect the will of Palestinians in its positions and work.\\n\\nDespite what the Israeli-US puppet regime in Ramallah may say, if Palestinians actually living in Palestine were free to exercise their right of self-determination then there would already be one state in all of Palestine. Undoubtedly, if many peace organizations such as VFP would grow a backbone, get some principles, and get off the fence then open Palestinian support for a one-state solution would be even stronger. Instead, we waffle out of ignorance, cowardice, and to placate supporters of Israel within the peace movement, such as JVP.\\n\\nHowever, to give credit where credit is due, JVP is correct when they say: \"the crisis in Israel and Palestine is rooted in the idea that Jewish lives matter more than Palestinian lives.\" The problem is that they do not extend that logic to the pre-1967 occupation of Palestine thus consigning themselves to a role as shills for Jewish supremacy in the 78% of Palestine forcibly seized in 1948.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n* \"Zionist\" is sometimes taken to be an epithet. It is used here as a descriptive term. Zionism is simply an ideology that supports the creation and maintenance of a Jewish state in Palestine. One distinction between Left and Right Zionists is that you will seldom find a Right Zionist criticizing or calling for an end to the Israeli occupation of the territories captured in 1967. For an article on Zionism in The Encyclopedia of Race and Racism click here.\\n\\n† AWRAD apparently stopped asking this question after 2010 perhaps because its result were problematic for the Palestinian Authority, which like AWRAD, is based in Ramallah.\\n\\nSee also: \"JVP\\'s Peace Malpractice\"',\n",

       " (\"As the mainstream media continues to report 24x7 on their Russian collusion narrative in a shameless attempt to take down a Republican administration without any actual evidence of wrongdoing, the Democrats find themselves embroiled in yet another actual scandal, with actual crimes, where people have actually been arrested by the FBI while actually trying to flee the country...yet shockingly, none of these actual crimes seem to be of any interest at all to traditional media outlets.\\n\\nBe that as it may, the rather curious case of Imran Awan continues with the latest development coming courtesy of the Daily Caller who notes that Imran was frantically liquidating nearly $2 million in real estate holdings right up until the day has was arrested at Dulles airport.\\n\\nImran Awan, a congressional aide arrested by the FBI after wiring $300,000 to Pakistan and misrepresenting the purpose, had previously wired money to the country and was frantically liquidating multiple real estate properties on the day he was arrested, The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group has learned. Imran’s real estate properties provide a source of money that could be sent directly to Pakistan when two upcoming home sales close. Prosecutors have since filed paperwork saying they fear “the dissipation of the proceeds of the fraud and destruction of evidence in other locations.” Imran was arrested July 24 — four months after the FBI says his wife Hina Alvi moved to Pakistan after learning the family was the subject of a criminal investigation into their work as IT administrators for House Democrats. On the day of Imran’s arrest, the couple accepted a buyer for one house owned by Hina with an asking price of $618,000 (Hawkshead Dr.) and listed another property for sale at $200,000 (Pembrook Village), real estate records show. On June 20, a third house his wife owned was “sold” to his brother-in-law for $360,000 (Sprayer St.). In November 2016, a fourth home his wife owned was “sold” to his brother Jamal for $620,000 (Linnett Hill Dr.). In both cases, the bank financed nearly all of the purchase.\\n\\nSo why real estate? As the Daily Caller notes, title companies, unlike individuals, can wire large sums of money to international bank accounts without arousing the suspicions of federal investigators.\\n\\nTitle companies can wire large sums abroad without attracting the suspicion Imran did at the bank, and with Hina — the nominal sole owner of each of the houses — residing in that country, it would be natural to send the proceeds to her. In addition to the three houses sold or slated to be sold since June 20, Imran’s lawyer, Chris Gowen, told The New York Times that the $283,000 wire in January was preceded by other similar transfers to Pakistan. “Gowen said the transfer represented the latest payment by his client for a piece of property he was buying in the country,” The Times reported. Gowen would not tell TheDCNF whether the proceeds of the $360,000 June 20 home sale were wired to Pakistan, nor where the income from the two upcoming sales would go. The office of the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia declined to comment on whether it would block the disbursements. The value of the known homes that have been sold since November or are currently being sold is $1.8 million. There is also the $283,000 January wire transfer from the Congressional bank, in addition to previous wires of unknown amounts that Imran’s lawyer acknowledged. Since Imran’s lawyer said the January wire of nearly $300,000 was the latest in a series of wires, the transfers may have been about moving money from the $4 million in House payments or other sources.\\n\\nAs we noted last week, Imran Awan was charged with bank fraud after being picked up by the FBI as Dulles airport while attempted to flee to Pakistan via Qatar. That said, it is still unclear whether that charge is just a placeholder for other charges that are yet to come.\\n\\nWhile details are scarce, media reports have alleged that Awan and his brothers potentially ran a procurement scheme in which they bought equipment, then overcharged various House members that employed their IT firm. Meanwhile, some congressional technology aides have alleged that the Awan’s were blackmailing representatives based on the contents of their emails and files, due to the fact that these representatives have displayed unwavering and intense loyalty towards the former aides.\\n\\nAs background, Imran was first employed in 2004 by former Democrat Rep. Robert Wexler (FL) as an “information technology director”, before he began working in Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s office in 2005.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe family was paid extremely well, with Imran Awan being paid nearly $2 million working as an IT support staffer for House Democrats since 2004. Abid Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, were each paid more than $1 million working for House Democrats. In total, since 2003, the family has collected nearly $5 million.\\n\\nIn total, Imran's firm was employed by 31 Democrats in Congress, some of whom held extremely sensitive positions on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.\\n\\nOf course, one of the most intriguing parts of the Awan narrative is precisely why former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (DWS) decided to keep him on her taxpayer-funded payroll right up until his arrest and whether that decision had anything to do with the whole DNC / Hillary email scandals that erupted last summer.\\n\\nA preliminary hearing for Awan is scheduled for August 21.\",\n",

       " ('As the water accumulated, it \"greased\\' the bottom of the glacier eventually causing the glacier to \"lurch forward\" suddenly producing at the same time a seismic event reaching as high as 5.1 on the moment-magnitude scale which is similar to the Richter scale.\\n\\nAccording to one of the scientists responsible for formulating the \"lurching glacier\" hypothesis:\\n\\n\"People often think of glaciers as inert and slow-moving, but in fact they can also move rather quickly,\" says Göran Ekström, professor of geology and geophysics at Harvard who will be moving to Lamont-Doherty in the spring. \"Some of Greenland’s glaciers, as large as Manhattan and as tall as the Empire State Building, can move 10 meters in less than a minute, a jolt that is sufficient to generate moderate seismic waves.\"\\n\\nNew research published recently Geophysical Research Letters disproves the \"lurching glacier\" hypothesis and proposes an alternative. The paper: Step-wise changes in glacier flow speed coincide with calving and glacial earthquakes at Helheim Glacier, Greenland [PDF--subscription required] proposes that ice berg calving at the glacier\\'s front causes both the glacial earthquakes and the increases in the glaciers rate of movement.\\n\\nThe research team, led by Meredith Nettles of Columbia University\\'s Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, employed a network of GPS receivers to take measurements both of glacial calving and glacial movement on Greenland\\'s Helheim Glacier. As the authors explain:\\n\\nWe operated a network of continuously recording Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers on Helheim Glacier for a period of ~50 days in 2007, from July 4 to August 24. Twelve receivers were installed on the glacier, in a configuration including stations both on and offset from the centerline (Figure 1). The stations spanned an along-flow distance of about 20 km, with the downflow stations located just behind the calving front. Several stations installed within a few km of the calving front were removed and relocated to points slightly farther upglacier during a midcampaign field visit. One GPS receiver was operated at a rock site near the glacier throughout the campaign to help define a stable local reference frame; two additional rock stations operated for shorter durations.\\n\\nSouthern Greenland, with locations of glacial earthquakes; arrow marks Helheim Glacier (inset). Geometry of GPS network at Helheim Glacier during summer, 2007, overlain on a 2001 LANDSAT image. The position of the calving front at two times during the summer of 2007 is shown by the black dotted lines (easternmost line, July 4; westernmost line, August 15). Blue dots, locations of GPS stations on the glacier surface at the time of deployment; black ring shows station IS38 (Figure 3). Red dots, locations of rock-based reference stations. Yellow arrows show average station velocities determined over the duration of station deployment; white arrow shows scale\\n\\nWhat the scientists learned over the course of their study, which took place during July and August, the peak calving periods, is that the glacial earthquakes were closely tied to calving events at the the mouth of the glacier. Major calving events usually preceded acceleration of glacier movement by anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour with a greater increase in glacier speed toward the front of the glacier and a lesser increase up-glacier. Interestingly the scientists did not observe a measurable coseismic displacement in association with Helheim\\'s glacial earthquakes. In other words the glacier maintained it\\'s its physical integrity although it began to move faster. Lending further support to the idea that it is the calving that causes both the earthquakes and the increase in glacial speed is the fact that the force of the glacial acceleration is insufficient to cause the seismic events as the earlier hypothesis had posited.\\n\\nOur combined seismological and geodetic observations suggest two plausible scenarios for glacier speedup. In the first, a large calving event leads to the loss of resisting forces at the calving front, resulting in glacier acceleration [e.g., Howat et al., 2005], and produces one or more glacial earthquakes, perhaps through one of the mechanisms of Tsai et al. [2008]. The apparent small difference in the timing of acceleration and calving results from the finite duration of the calving process, the uncertainties in our estimate of the time of glacier acceleration, or both. In this scenario, the seismic precursors to the glacial earthquakes are associated with disintegration of the calving front in preparation for a major calving event. In the second scenario, the glacier accelerates as a result of a process other than calving, such as the passage of a meltwater pulse under the glacier, and this process leads to calving and associated glacial earthquakes. The speedup is sustained and perhaps enhanced by a calving-related loss of resisting forces at the calving front. In either scenario, changes in tidewater-glacier speed are closely tied to the behavior of the glacier terminus.\\n\\nThe second scenario still has meltwater playing a role as a contributing factor to iceberg calving and earthquakes, which in turn lead to faster glacial movement. But the calving and the earthquakes are seen now as the proximate cause of the increase in the rate of glacial movement rather than as an effect.\\n\\nThe researchers conclude:\\n\\nOur results demonstrate that large outlet glaciers can accelerate in a near-instantaneous, step-like fashion, and show a clear link between such acceleration and large calving events. In addition, our observations invalidate the lurching-glacier model [Ekström et al., 2003; Tsai and Ekström, 2007] for Greenland\\'s glacial earthquakes, and tie the earthquake source closely to processes at the calving front. The glacial earthquakes and the rapid accelerations we document emphasize the importance of short-time-scale processes occurring at Greenland\\'s outlet glaciers, and highlight the need to understand the role such processes play in controlling longer-term, seasonal and interannual, variability in glacier behavior.\\n\\nHere are some images of the Helheim glacier from NASA\\'s Earth Observatory:\\n\\nThese images from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) on NASA’s Terra satellite show the Helheim glacier in June 2005 (top), July 2003 (middle), and May 2001 (bottom). The glacier occupies the left part of the images, while large and small icebergs pack the narrow fjord in the right part of the images. Bare ground appears brown or tan, while vegetation appears in shades of red.\\n\\nFrom the 1970s until about 2001, the position of the glacier’s margin changed little. But between 2001 and 2005, the margin retreated landward about 7.5 kilometers (4.7 miles), and its speed increased from 8 to 11 kilometers per year. Between 2001 and 2003, the glacier also thinned by up to 40 meters (about 131 feet). Scientists believe the retreat of the ice margin plays a big role in the glacier’s acceleration. As the margin of the glacier retreats back toward land, the mass of grounded ice that once acted like a brake on the glacier’s speed is released, allowing the glacier to speed up.\\n\\nNote: Here then you have another example of real science, in which one hypothesis is proposed and then discarded in favor of another as the evidence changes. (Note that Dr. Nettles was one of the researches on the team that came up with the original \"lurching glacier\" hypothesis, which this study duscredits. This is true \"skepticism\" in action where one honestly weighs all the data and revises one\\'s opinions based on the credibility of the evidence free from any political agenda. The denialists/delayers who like to style themselves as \"skeptics\" have nothing to do with this process of scientific inquiry. Instead, their goal, when they are not outright lying, is to cherry pick the data in search only of those studies which might possibly be construed to support their positions.\\n\\nRelated post:\\n\\nOcean Cooling: A Science Lesson for Denialists/Delayers\\n\\nCrossposted at Climaticide Chronicles',\n",

       " ('As we enter the second decade since the demise of the Soviet Union as a political entity, Soviet propaganda is as influential as ever. Indeed, Soviet propaganda will influence the success or failure of the new Bush administration and could even ultimately decide the fate of the two-century-old “American experiment.”\\n\\nIn the struggle for world influence, Soviet propagandists realized that non-Soviet whites were a small minority of the world’s population occupying a small part of the earth’s landmass (Europe and North America). In their propaganda, the Soviets undertook to isolate the Western alliance from what today we call “people of color.”\\n\\nEurope was attacked for imperialism toward its African and Asian colonies. The United States was attacked for denying civil rights to blacks.\\n\\nSoviet propaganda was amazingly successful. The charge that the West was racist became enshrined in European and British universities and foreign ministries. Many a professor made a career declaiming his country’s mistreatment of darker skinned peoples.\\n\\nIn the United States, this propaganda is the loudest voice in our universities. There are more academics teaching the evils of white racist hegemony than there are teaching physics, chemistry or mathematics. Our Founding Fathers, along with white men in general, have been reinvented as racist pigs.\\n\\nThis propaganda has succeeded among blacks and whites alike. The majority of black leaders believe that black interests and white interests are opposed and irreconcilable, requiring preferences for racial minorities “to level the playing field.”\\n\\nIn response to the charge of racism, white policymakers have put in place a system of unconstitutional racial preferences that have expanded to include other “victim” groups. These preferences have destroyed equality by granting status-based legal privileges to “victims of white male hegemony.”\\n\\nTo be accused of racism has become a serious offense, and people are punished for “hate speech” and “hate thought.” Paradoxically, Republicans have been branded the “racist party” — despite the facts that Republicans, led by Sen. Everett Dirksen, broke the filibuster against the 1964 Civil Rights Bill and the Nixon administration imposed the first racial quotas.\\n\\nIn the recent presidential election, 90 percent of blacks and two-thirds of Hispanics voted against the Republican candidate, George W. Bush, despite his sincere outreach. Sensitive to the charge of racism, Republicans have concluded that they must do more to win black and Hispanic votes. Writing in The Wall Street Journal on Jan. 2, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said: “The first and most important task for Republicans must be to foster better relations with Americans of color. This is a moral and practical imperative.”\\n\\nRepublicans should reach out to blacks and immigrants, and try to convince them that political liberty and individual freedom rest on the Constitution’s guarantee of “the equal protection of the laws” — the antithesis of differential group rights.\\n\\nORDER IT NOW\\n\\nRepublicans should not compete with Democrats who proposition black and brown voters with special preferences based on their skin color. Preferences destroy equality before the law and lead us back to the status-based law of the feudal era. If we ignore the Constitution’s requirement of equality in law, there is little to constrain us from ignoring the rest of our governing document. It is a mistake to compete for the black vote in a way that leads to tyranny.\\n\\nIf Republicans pander to minorities with preferences, Republicans will lose the white vote that is disadvantaged by preferences. In a convincing article, Steve Sailer argues that Bush’s narrow win was not due to his loss of 77 percent of the minority vote but to his winning “a measly 54 percent of the white vote.”\\n\\nThe president-elect’s father won 59 percent of the white vote in 1988. If George W. had won 57 percent, instead of 54 percent, he would have crushed Al Gore in the Electoral College 367 to 171.\\n\\nGeorge W. barely eked out a win, because he lost ground with white voters. Sailer argues that Republicans stand to gain far more votes from white households than from racial minorities whose leaders are wedded to racial preferences. The real threat to the Republican Party, says Sailer, is the vast unrestricted immigration from Third World countries that is lessening the value of the white vote. If nothing is done about immigration, whites will become a minority, a minority without preferences.\\n\\nDr. Roberts’ latest book, “The Tyranny of Good Intentions,” has just been released by Prima Publishers.

And according to Bloomberg, Russian businessmen are scrambling right now to protect assets and avoid the list.\\n\\nSome people who think they’re likely to land on the list have stress-tested the potential impact on their investments, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Others are liquidating holdings, according to their U.S. advisers. Russian businessmen have approached former Treasury and State Department officials with experience in sanctions for help staying off the list, said Dan Fried, who previously worked at the State Department and said he turned down such offers. Some Russians sent proxies to Washington in an attempt to avoid lobbying disclosures, according to one person that was contacted.\\n\\nAnd with Russia-friendly lobbyists such as the Podesta Group and Paul Manafort\\'s operations shuttered, many desperate Russian oligarchs have been cut off from their D.C. influence peddlers.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Treasury officials are reportedly growing concerned over the list, as they worry some people will conflate it with Obama-era sanctions. Moreover, portions of the report may be classified and issued in the form of a letter - as opposed to releasing it through the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) which is responsible for issuing sanctions.\\n\\n“You’re going to have people getting shamed. It’s a step below a sanction because it doesn’t actually block any assets, but has the same optics as sanctions -- you’re on a list of people who are engaged in doing bad things.” -Erich Ferrari, Ferrari & Associates\\n\\nCorruption Index\\n\\nThe Treasury\\'s report must include \"indices of corruption,\" which will list any foreign assets next to an oligarch considered corrupt. “Because of the nervousness that the Russian business community is facing, a number of oligarchs are already beginning to wind back businesses, treating them as if they are already designated, to stay ahead of it,” said Daniel Tannebaum, head of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s global financial sanctions unit.\\n\\nVladimir Putin has warned wealthy nationals over worsening U.S. sanctions, and provided them with a capital amnesty program designed to allow oligarchs to repatriate some of their overseas assets. Meanwhile, Putin has issued special bonds which will allow the wealthy to hold assets outside of the reach of the U.S. Treasury.\\n\\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday that Russia will react to any punitive measures against its businessmen, stating \"The principle of reciprocity remains,\" suggesting that Putin would employ a commensurate response to a U.S. crackdown on oligarchs.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTrump\\'s new Executive Order may explain asset shuffle\\n\\nPerhaps one of the main drivers behind Russian oligarchs shedding assets before the U.S. Treasury\\'s \"indices of corruption\" are released is an Executive Order signed quietly in Late December which freezes the U.S. housed assets of foreign government officials or executives of foreign corporations deemed to be corrupt.\\n\\nIn fact, anyone in the world who has \"materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material or technological support for, or goods or services\" to foreigners targeted by the Executive Order is subject to frozen assets. This would apply to D.C. lobbyists working for corrupt Russian oligarchs, or U.S. government officials who have, say, effectuated a uranium deal deemed corrupt.\\n\\nWhile it has yet to be seen whether the asset liquidations will affect any specific sectors, one should keep an eye out for any red-dawn related volatility over the next two weeks.',\n",

       " ('As world powers debate what a comprehensive nuclear deal with Iran should look like, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to maintain that Israel is not bound by the interim agreement that the P5+1 and Iran struck in Geneva on November 24. Israel, says Netanyahu, “has the right and the obligation to defend itself.” One question then is whether Netanyahu actually intends to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. The other question, no less important, is whether Israel could really pull it off.\\n\\nAmerican analysts are divided on Israel’s ability to take effective military action. However, history shows that Israel’s military capabilities are typically underestimated. The Israel Defense Forces keep finding creative ways to deceive and cripple their targets by leveraging their qualitative advantages in manners that confound not only skeptical observers but also, and more important, Israel’s enemies.\\n\\nMilitary triumphs like the Six-Day War of June 1967 and the 1976 raid on Entebbe that freed 101 hostages are popular Israeli lore for good reason—these “miraculous” victories were the result of assiduously planned, rehearsed, and well-executed military operations based on the elements of surprise, deception, and innovation, core tenets of Israeli military thinking. Inscribed on one of the walls of the IDF’s officer training academy is the verse from Proverbs 24:6: “For by clever deception thou shalt wage war.” And this has been the principle driving almost all of Israel’s most successful campaigns, like the 1981 bombing of Iraq’s nuclear reactor, the 1982 Beka’a Valley air battle, and the 2007 raid on Syria’s plutonium reactor, all of which were thought improbable, if not impossible, until Israel made them reality.\\n\\nAnd yet in spite of Israel’s record, some American experts remain skeptical about Israel’s ability to do anything about Iran’s nuclear weapons facilities. Even the most optimistic assessments argue that Israel can only delay the inevitable. As a September 2012 report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies contends: “Israel does not have the capability to carry out preventive strikes that could do more than delay Iran’s efforts for a year or two.” An attack, it continued, “would be complex and high risk in the operational level and would lack any assurances of a high mission success rate.” Equally cautious is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, who argued that while “Israel has the capability to strike Iran and to delay the production or the capability of Iran to achieve a nuclear weapons status,” such a strike would only delay the program “for a couple of years.” The most pessimistic American assessments contend that Israel is all but neutered. Former director of the CIA Michael Hayden, for instance, said that airstrikes capable of seriously setting back Iran’s nuclear program are beyond Israel’s capacity.\\n\\nPart of the reason that Israeli and American assessments diverge is the difference in the two countries’ recent military histories and political cultures. While the American debate often touches on the limits of military power and its ability to secure U.S. interests around the globe, the Israeli debate is narrower, befitting the role of a regional actor rather than a superpower, and focuses solely on Israel’s ability to provide for the security of its citizens at home. That is to say, even if Israel and the United States saw Iran and its nuclear arms program in exactly the same light, there would still be a cultural gap. Accordingly, an accurate understanding of how Israelis see their own recent military history provides an important insight into how Israel’s elected leaders and military officials view the IDF’s abilities regarding Iran.\\n\\nAny account of surprise and deception as key elements in Israeli military history has to start with the aerial attack that earned Israel total air supremacy over its adversaries in the June 1967 war. Facing the combined Arab armies, most prominently those of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, Israel’s Air Force was outnumbered by a ratio of 3 planes to 1. Nonetheless, at the very outset of the war, the IAF dispatched its jets at a time when Egyptian pilots were known to be having breakfast. Israeli pilots targeted the enemy’s warplanes on their runways, and in two subsequent waves of sorties, destroyed the remainder of the Egyptian Air Force, as well as Jordan’s and most of Syria’s. Within six hours, over 400 Arab planes, virtually all of the enemy’s aircraft, were in flames, with Israel losing only 19 planes.\\n\\nIsrael’s sweeping military victory over the next six days was due to its intimate familiarity with its enemy’s operational routines—and to deception. For instance, just before the actual attack was launched, a squad of four Israeli training jets took off, with their radio signature mimicking the activity of multiple squadrons on a training run. Because all of Israel’s 190 planes were committed to the operation, those four planes were used to make the Egyptians believe that the IAF was simply training as usual. The IAF’s stunning success was the result not only of intelligence and piloting but also of initiative and creativity, ingredients that are nearly impossible to factor into standard predictive models.\\n\\nThe 1981 raid on Iraq’s nuclear reactor at Osirak is another example of Israel’s ability to pull off operations that others think it can’t. The success caught experts by surprise because every assessment calculated that the target was out of the flight range of Israel’s newly arrived F-16s. The former deputy chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in Israel Bill Brown recounted that on the day after the attack, “I went in with our defense attaché, Air Force Colonel Pete Hoag, to get a briefing from the chief of Israeli military intelligence. He laid out how they had accomplished this mission. . . . Hoag kept zeroing in on whether they had refueled the strike aircraft en route, because headquarters of the U.S. Air Force in Washington wanted to know, among other things, how in the world the Israelis had refueled these F-16s. The chief of Israeli military intelligence kept saying: ‘We didn’t refuel.’ For several weeks headquarters USAF refused to believe that the Israelis could accomplish this mission without refueling.”\\n\\nWashington later learned that Israel’s success came from simple and creative field improvisations. First, the pilots topped off their fuel tanks on the tarmac, with burners running, only moments before takeoff. Then, en route, they jettisoned their nondetachable fuel drop tanks to reduce air friction and optimize gas usage. Both these innovations involved some degree of risk, as they contravened safety protocols. However, they gave the Israeli jets the extra mileage needed to safely reach Baghdad and return, and also to gain the element of surprise by extending their reach beyond what the tables and charts that guided thinking in Washington and elsewhere had assumed possible.\\n\\nSurprise won Israel a similar advantage one year later in the opening maneuvers of the 1982 invasion of Lebanon. For students of aerial warfare, the Beka’a Valley air battle is perhaps Israel’s greatest military maneuver, even surpassing the June 1967 campaign. On June 9, Israel destroyed the entire Soviet-built Syrian aerial array in a matter of hours. Ninety Syrian MiGs were downed and 17 of 19 surface-to-air missile batteries were put out of commission, while the Israeli Air Force suffered no losses. The brutal—and for Israel, still controversial—nature of the Lebanon war of which this operation was part dimmed its shine in popular history, but the operation is still studied around the world. At the time it left analysts dumbfounded.\\n\\nThe 1982 air battle was the culmination of several years’ worth of tension on Israel’s northern border. Israel was concerned that Syria’s deployment of advanced aerial defense systems in Lebanon’s Beka’a Valley would limit its freedom to operate against PLO attacks from Lebanon. When Syria refused to pull back its defenses and U.S. mediation efforts failed, Israel planned for action. Although Israel was widely understood to enjoy a qualitative advantage, no one could have imagined the knockout blow it was about to deliver. Israel launched its aerial campaign on the fourth day of the offensive, commencing with a wave of unmanned proto-drones that served as decoys to trigger the Syrian radars. Rising to the bait, the aerial defense units launched rockets and thus exposed their locations to Israel’s artillery batteries and air-to-ground missiles. In parallel, Israel used advanced electronic jammers to further incapacitate Syrian radars, which cleared the path for the IAF’s fighter-bombers to attack the remaining missile launchers. When Syrian pilots scrambled for their planes, their communications had already been severed and their radars blinded. Israeli pilots later noted the “admirable bravery” of their Syrian counterparts, whom they downed at a ratio of 90 to 0.\\n\\nA RAND report later concluded that Israel’s success was due not to its technological advantage. “The Syrians were simply outflown and outfought by vastly superior Israeli opponents. . . . The outcome would most likely have been heavily weighted in Israel’s favor even had the equipment available to each side been reversed. At bottom, the Syrians were . . . [defeated] by the IDF’s constant retention of the operational initiative and its clear advantages in leadership, organization, tactical adroitness, and adaptability.” In other words, Israel won because of its creative and skillful orchestration of a well-organized fighting force.\\n\\nAnd then there is Israel’s most recent high-profile conflict with Syria. When Israeli intelligence discovered that Bashar al-Assad’s regime was building a plutonium reactor in the northeast Syrian Desert, Israeli and American leaders disagreed on the best course of action. Israel’s then-prime minister Ehud Olmert argued for a military solution, while the Bush administration feared the risks, demurred, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice pushed to take the matter to the U.N. The Israelis, however, confident in their cyberwarfare capabilities, knew they could disable Syria’s air defenses. Moreover, as careful students of Syrian decision-making, they believed they could destroy the reactor without triggering a costly reaction from Assad. And on September 6, 2007, Israel once again overturned the expert predictions and assessments of others and successfully destroyed the Syrian reactor at Al Kibar.\\n\\nWith Iran, American and Israeli leaders once again disagree on what might be gained by a military strike. While the American debate is riddled with doubts about the efficacy of force, Israeli experts harbor far fewer doubts. As former chief of military intelligence Amos Yadlin asserts unequivocally: “It can be done.” There are some Israeli strategists less optimistic, but the nature of their dissent is fundamentally different from that of American skeptics. U.S. policymakers and analysts question Israel’s ability to strike, or how far even the most successful strike might set back Iran’s nuclear program, but Israelis largely believe they can take effective military action. The question for Israeli strategists is at what cost? A 2012 IAF impact evaluation report predicted 300 civilian casualties in the event of an Iranian retaliatory missile attack. Former defense minister Ehud Barak offered a higher number, contending that open conflict with Iran would claim less than 500 Israeli casualties. Responding to Barak’s relatively optimistic assessment, onetime Mossad director Meir Dagan argued instead that an attack on Iran would take a heavy toll in terms of loss of life and would paralyze life in Israel.\\n\\nRegardless of the number of potential casualties, the frank discussion of what an attack on Iran might cost Israel in human lives is an essential part of preparing the country, and steeling it, for the possibility of war. Israel has also devoted material resources to the eventuality of a military campaign against the regime in Tehran. According to Ehud Olmert, Israel has spent over $10 billion on preparations for a potential showdown with Iran. “We’ve worked long and hard to prepare ourselves,” former IDF chief of staff Gabi Ashkenazi said recently. Israel, he added, “will be able to deal with the consequences of a military attack on Iran.”\\n\\nThe question of how exactly Israel might act to stop the Iranian nuclear program is an open one. In part, that’s because it’s hard to know how Israeli strategists see the problem or might reconfigure the working paradigm. The basic operational assumption is that Israel would attack from the air, but who knows? If the goal is to slow down Iran’s nuclear program, there are other ways to do it, perhaps by targeting Iran’s economy, its powergrid, its oil fields, or the regime itself. Or military action might not take the form of an aerial attack at all, but rather a commando heist of Iran’s uranium. Recall the raid on Entebbe: With commandos operating 2,000 miles from Israel’s borders disguised as a convoy carrying the Ugandan leader Idi Amin, that 1976 operation, like many of Israel’s air triumphs, combined strategic surprise with tactical deception.\\n\\nWhat is certain, however—what many historical precedents make clear—is that it would be an error of the first order to dismiss Israel’s ability to take meaningful military action against Iran. Israel has left its enemies, as well as American policymakers and military experts, surprised in the past, and it may very well do so again.\\n\\nUri Sadot is a research associate at the Council on Foreign Relations and holds a master’s degree in international affairs from Princeton University.',\n",

       " ('As you saw in Marcy’s posts yesterday, emptywheel is celebrating the ten year anniversary of the move from The Next Hurrah to Firedoglake. You will notice that the current version of the blog comes to you without ads. If you want this wonderful state of affairs to continue, contributions are a must. A new subscription option helps to make sure the hamsters keep turning the wheels on the magic blog-hosting machines and the ever more sophisticated mole-whacking machinery stays up to date.\\n\\nMarcy’s outstanding work over the years has received great acclaim. A huge part of the success of the blog, though, has been its ongoing tradition of the best commenting community on the internet. Over the years, the conversations that have taken place on each seminal post have helped to decipher the meaning of cryptic government documents, bring in alternate views and point out new information as it breaks. In the end, emptywheel isn’t just a blog, it’s a community. For all of your support and participation during these trying times, we thank you.\\n\\nIn keeping with the “10” theme, Marcy has a post highlighting her favorite surveillance posts over each of the last ten years. She has graciously allowed a few of us hangers-on to participate with posts of our own. I haven’t been an official emptywheeler for all of those ten years. I did spend a year as an evening editor at Firedoglake around the time of the migration from TNH, so I got to start my friendship with this group of writers and commenters around that time. I’m going to list my favorite ten posts from the time I started posting here, shortly after the blog moved from Firedoglake to the independent site. Several of these posts link back to earlier work at MyFDL. Sadly, the archives of that work were imperfectly migrated to the Shadowproof successor to Firedoglake, and so searching for those is imperfect and many of the graphics are lost.\\n\\nSo here is Jim’s Dimestore listing my 10 favorite posts on Emptywheel.net, in chronological order:\\n\\nPerhaps my favorite topic over the years has been a technical analysis of the evidence presented by the FBI in its Amerithrax investigation. It is absolutely clear from this analysis of the anthrax attacks of 2001 that the FBI failed to demonstrate how Bruce Ivins could have carried out the attacks on his own. This post goes deep into the technical weeds of how the spores in the attack material were treated so that they would disperse easily and seem to float on air. The bottom line is that high amounts of silicon are found inside these spores. The silicon could not have gotten there naturally, and it took very sophisticated chemistry to get it there and treat it to make sure it stayed. Ivins had neither the expertise nor the equipment to achieve this highly advanced bioweaponization. Earlier work I did in this series showed that Ivins also could not have grown the anthrax used in the attacks. My favorite candidate for where it was produced is an isolated lab built by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency on what is now called the Nevada National Security Site (formerly the Nevada Test Site) that Judy Miller described on September 4, 2001. That article by Miller has always stood out to me as the ultimate limited hangout presented by DoD before the fact, where we see a facility of the perfect size for producing the amount of material used in the anthrax attacks. Those attacks occurred just a short time after the article was published. Miller’s assurance in the article that the site only was used for production of harmless bacteria sharing some characteristics with anthrax just never smelled right to me.\\n\\nWhen Michael Hastings’ article in Rolling Stone led to Stanley McChrystal’s firing, little did we know that this would be the beginning of the fall from grace for David Petraeus and his all-star band of torture enablers. These “operators”, as Hastings termed the team, relied on night raids and illegal detentions as the core of their counterterrorism initiatives in Iraq and Afghanistan. These foolishly evil practices fueled massive growth in the insurgencies in response. In this post, Flynn reveals to us that he felt McChrystal, and everyone else, has a “dark side”. As we now await fallout from Flynn’s guilty plea for his lies to the FBI about conversations with Russian Ambassador Kislyak (mainly, his testimony against the rest of Trump’s team), it appears that Flynn himself found the dark side to be quite compelling.\\n\\nAnother favorite topic of mine over the years has been the utter futility of the military’s efforts to “train” troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan. It has been an endless sequence of the military getting countless “do-overs”, with Congress rolling over and believing every single utterance of “This time it will work for sure!”. Part of the military’s strategy in hiding their training failures was to keep changing how Afghan troops were counted and evaluated for combat readiness. A corollary to the futility of the training effort is the horrific death toll of “green on blue” attacks, where the Afghan or Iraqi trainees attacked and often killed those who were training them. When this problem got especially bad in Afghanistan in 2011, DoD commissioned a sociological analysis that returned a result the military did not like. The report indicated that the military was utterly failing to address vast cultural differences between Afghan and coalition troops. The military, in its infinite wisdom, decided to classify the report, but did so after it already had been released in unclassified form. Oops.\\n\\nNeocons have long lusted after violent regime change in Iran. Cooked up allegations on Iran’s nuclear capabilities have played a central role over the years in how they wished to achieve that war. Despite the neocons’ best efforts to sabotage negotiations, Iran agreed to a comprehensive set of severe restrictions on its nuclear capabilities in return for “dropping” (quotes because the US has claimed other grounds for maintaining other sanctions) the worst of the US sanctions that crippled Iran’s economy. Along the way, I had a ton of fun picking at two of the worst offenders in spreading anti-Iran propaganda: David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security and George Jahn of AP. Reports that Iran had constructed a high explosives blast chamber at the Parchin military site became quite a point of argument. Albright spent countless hours scouring satellite images of the site and claimed the photographs showed that Iran was attempting to clean radioactivity from the site. Iran seemed to have a lot of fun with this process. I’m sure the pink tarps in the post here were added just to punk Albright. I maintained that the real evidence of what had taken place at the site couldn’t be scrubbed, because the accused activity would have resulted in the steel chamber itself being made radioactive throughout its entire thickness. Perhaps Iran made the same assessment, because once the IAEA gained access to the site, there was no steel chamber to be found. Was there ever a blast chamber there? Who knows? In the end, whether Iran carried out that work is immaterial, as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action has the most aggressive inspection regime ever agreed to by a country that hasn’t just lost a war. We can rest assured that Iran has no capability at the current time of assembling a nuclear weapon, and the neocons are left to pout about diplomacy working better than their war ever could have. If you want to know why Donald Trump put Rex Tillerson in charge of dismantling the Department of State, look no further than the success diplomacy played in achieving the JCPOA.\\n\\nWhen a massive explosion in West, Texas killed 15 people, injured over 250 and destroyed 500 homes, it was clear to me who had killed these Texans: Ayn Rand’s mythical libertarian hero John Galt. How else do you explain a site being allowed to store hundreds of thousands of pounds of ammonium nitrate with inadequate fire protection and fatally close to inhabited structures than the misguided libertarian belief that free enterprise should rule? In the post, I pointed to the dangers inherent in the lack of zoning laws that allowed this fatal mixture of structures. As we later learned from the Washington Post, John Galt’s influence on the destruction was decades in the making:\\n\\nThe plant was a mom-and-pop operation, a distribution center where farmers picked up custom mixes of fertilizer to boost crop yields. It was built in 1962 a half-mile outside West. As the harvests grew, so did the town. In 1967, the rest home opened 629 feet from the plant. In the early ’70s, a two-story apartment complex was built even closer. Then a playground and basketball court, a mere 249 feet away.\\n\\nWe learned last year that ATF has determined that the fire that preceded the blast was intentional. So while we don’t know who started the fire itself, we know for a fact that, ultimately, it was John Galt who killed these 15 Texans.\\n\\nThe current concern that Donald Trump will lash out in fury with a nuclear strike, somewhere, anywhere, just to vent his anger over Mueller’s noose tightening over his entire administration is not the first time that it was appropriate to be concerned about an enraged high-ranking government official killing innocent people. In the case of John Brennan, poorly targeted rage attacks carried out as retaliation for a perceived wrong happened repeatedly. In the post linked here, a drone strike in Pakistan’s tribal area seemed timed as retaliation for Pakistan refusing to reopen supply routes that had been closed six months earlier when the US killed 24 Pakistani troops in an erroneous attack. The post goes on to detail other rage drone strikes that Brennan ordered, with the worst probably being the killing of over 40 people who were simply gathered to discuss mineral rights. That strike was carried out the day after the CIA’s Raymond Davis was finally released and was clearly carried out without proper evaluation of targeting criteria, as it seems few if any actual terrorists were killed.\\n\\nThe Ebola outbreak in 2014 led to widespread fear in the US, especially when it was announced that medical personnel who had been treating Ebola patients in Africa and became infected would be transported to Atlanta for treatment. There was no appreciation for how the disease actually is spread, what the conditions were where the medical workers became infected in Africa and how such spread would be much less likely in a properly run US hospital. A poorly run hospital in Texas, however, did manage to have personnel treating Ebola acquire infections. Of course, the treatment at CDC in Atlanta was carried out without incident, and the virus did not spread in the US, even after the Texas hospital had its initial failure. In fact, as the virus wound down, those who study and understand the virus were shown to have been completely correct in their analysis when they modeled how large the outbreak would get before receding once proper intervention was carried out. But the fears of Ebola wiping out the US weren’t the only bit of bad science that had to be knocked down during the outbreak. Conspiracy theories started spreading that the Ebola virus in the 2014 outbreak had been genetically engineered in a bioweapons lab and was accidentally released from a lab in Africa. DNA sequence analysis quickly debunked that one.\\n\\nYes, the Iran nuclear agreement is so important that it is the only topic repeated in my ten favorite posts. In this post, we are in the time just a few months before the agreement is finalized, and the neocon opponents of the deal are reaching a fever pitch. The post outlines a horrible failure of full disclosure by the Washington Post. This occurred after Bezos purchased the paper, but clearly was a failure of beating back the darkness in which democracy dies. In this case, the Post carried an op-ed opposing the Iran deal. Besides allowing an incendiary headline (The Iran Time Bomb) and giving voice to Michael Hayden and neocon nightmare Ray Takeyh, the Post made its biggest failure regarding the middle author, Olli Heinonen. The Post allowed Heinonen to identify himself only by his current Harvard affiliation and his former role in IAEA. What is left out of that description is that Heinonen was also playing a prominent role on the Advisory Board of United Against Nuclear Iran, shadowy group with even more shadowy funding sources. Somehow, in the course of its “advocacy” work against Iran, UANI had come into possession of US state secrets that suddenly allowed it to avoid a civil case for defamation of a businessman they accused of breaking sanctions against Iran. Why, yes, of course the New York Times also allowed Heinonen to deceptively carry out his work on their pages, too. This time it was in a “news” story that came out shortly after the UANI civil court case was dismissed when the judge stated the case could not proceed because of the state secrets involved. Of course, even after more than two and a half years, neither the Washington Post nor New York Times have admitted their omissions in describing Heinonen’s affiliations in the cited articles. It is really remarkable that diplomacy defeated this full court press by the neocons who were working with the full cooperation of the media.\\n\\nI haven’t written much in the last couple of years, but I just couldn’t avoid writing this one only ten days after surgery to replace my aorta. When I saw Khizr Khan’s appearance at the Democratic National Convention, I was really moved when he waved his pocket copy of the Constiution at Donald Trump. I had done the same thing in July of 2008 when Nancy Pelosi appeared at Netroots Nation in Austin. I was waving my Constitution at Pelosi to remind her of her failure to impeach George W. Bush and Dick Cheney for their roles in torture and illegal wars. Khan was calling out Trump for his campaign promises that so clearly violate the Constiution. Sadly, Trump has followed through in enforcing many of those policies Khan warned us about and we are left without much more recourse than continuing to wave our Constitutions at those who violate it on a daily basis.\\n\\nMy one minor contribution so far to the unfolding saga of Russian influence on the 2016 election was prompted by noticing a photo in my Twitter stream shortly after the George Papadopoulos plea agreement was made public. What initially caught my eye was that my Congressman, Ted Yoho, was in the photo with Papadopoulos while both appeared in a panel discussion in Cleveland in July of 2016. However, once I started digging into the circumstances of the photo, I discovered that when he appeared for the panel, Papadopoulos claimed an affiliation with an entity that was also an affiliation for the shadowy Joseph Mifsud. We still don’t have a satisfactory explanation of how these two came to have a shared cover organization where it seems both Papadopoulos and Mifsud had positions that were grossly inflated with respect to their previous career accomplishments. I still think that if we ever discover who was behind these two getting such inflated positions, we will learn much about who might have been orchestrating later events in which these two played roles.',\n",

       " ('Aside from a slew of US economic data, including GDP and durable goods, today\\'s key event will be Donald Trump\\'s address at Davos at 8am EST, where attention will focus on the president\\'s take on trade and currency \"conflicts.\" Ahead of his main speech, however, Trump had a lengthy interview with CNBC\\'s Joe Kernen in which he touched on everything from trade, to the market, to the government shutdown and immigration law, and of course, the role of the dollar.\\n\\nOnce again refuting recent anti-USD sentiment, Trump countered the market interpretation of Mnuchin’s comments, saying he \"ultimately wants to see a strong USD\".\\n\\n“It’s your great reserve currency. There can never be anything even close to it. There is nothing close to it, there never will be,” Trump told CNBC, explaining that \"we are doing so well, our country is becoming so economically strong again – and strong in other ways too, by the way – that the dollar is going to get stronger and stronger.\" Then, in a paradoxical twist, Trump said \"nobody should be talking” about the dollar, \"It should be what it is/\"\\n\\nHere is the full excerpt:\\n\\nSo let me tell you, I think they were taken out of context because I read his exact statement. I\\'ll tell you where I stand, which ultimately is very important. Number one, I don\\'t like talking about it because, frankly, nobody should be talking about it. It should be what it is. It should also be based on the strength of the country. We are doing so well, our country is becoming so economically strong again – and strong in other ways too, by the way – that the dollar is going to get stronger and stronger. And ultimately, I want to see a strong dollar. Right now it floats. But it\\'s your great reserve currency. There can never be anything even close to it. There is nothing close to it, there never will be. But ultimately the dollar, because our country is going to get so much stronger economically, if you look at what\\'s happened to our country over the – look, I\\'ve been talking about this with you for 25 years…\\n\\nTrump\\'s dollar endorsement triggered a temporary reversal of USD weakness on Thursday, although it has since continued to decline and his latest comments barely registered on the Bloomberg dollar index.\\n\\nTouching on other key topics, Trump told Kernen that Democrats wouldn’t want another government shutdown \"because you look at every poll, it said they made a mistake.\" More in the excerpt:\\n\\nWe want to do what\\'s right and we\\'re going to do what\\'s right, and we\\'re going to solve the DACA problem. And I don\\'t think the Democrats would want to pull another shutdown. But we\\'ll get it solved. And if we need a little more time, we\\'ll take a little more time. I want to get the problem solved correctly\\n\\nTrump also spoke about what he considers the impact of reduced regulations on U.S. gross domestic product:\\n\\nNow, in my first quarter, which I consider to be the second quarter because I was there now long enough to have made an impact and don\\'t kid yourself, regulations are just as big as the tax cuts. I\\'ve cut more regulations than any President in history and I\\'ve been here for one year. You can take their term whether it\\'s eight years or 16 years in one instance— but you can take anybody you want, in one year, we\\'ve cut more regulations. And by the way, there\\'s going to be regulation but they\\'re good, solid, sane regulations. But in quarter two, we had 3.1, and in quarter three, as you know, we had 3.2. But in quarter one, which is the Obama quarter— really the last, I would say, Obama quarter, you had 1.2. We were going in the wrong direction.\\n\\nAs he has done a lot lately, Trump also took credit for the market\\'s soaring performance, predicting that had Democrats won, the S&P would be 50% lower:\\n\\nNot only did Jamie Dimon say he thought 3% [GDP] was possible, he said we could get to 4 percent in 2018. Lloyd Blankfein, and I pressed him a little because I said, \"That was not the outcome – the election that you were, I think, hoping for. Now that you\\'ve seen what\\'s happened to the stock market, up 40% since Election Day, how businesses are growing confidence, are you happy with the outcome?\"...\\n\\n\\n\\nHad the Democrat won — the stock market is up almost 50% since my election — had the Democrat won, I believe you would have been down 50. That\\'s the direction we were headed. And you know, a lot of that, regulation. It was staggering. You could not do anything\\n\\nFinally, looking at Trump\\'s upcoming main event speech at Davos, Bloomberg reporter Jennifer Jacobs previewed: \"Trump’s speech in Davos this morning will last about 15 minutes. He’ll talk about how he’s made the US attractive for business, a senior administration official told reporters. Trump won’t get the new GDP numbers until the speech is over, though, aide said.\" That said, Citi\\'s FX desk doubts the America first message will be favorable for USD today.\\n\\nTrump\\'s full interview below:\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd transcript:',\n",

No group has had such an outsized influence per capita as all of you standing before you and all of those who went before me and all of those who went before you.”\\n\\n“You make up 11 percent of the seats in the United States Congress. You make up one-third of all Nobel laureates,” he said. “So many notions that are embraced by this nation that particularly emanate from over 5000 years of Jewish history, tradition and culture: independence, individualism, fairness, decency, justice, charity. These are all as you say, as I learned early on as a Catholic being educated by my friends, this tzedakah.”\\n\\n“The embrace of immigration” is part of that, as is the involvement of Jews in social justice movements.\\n\\n“You can’t talk about the civil rights movement in this country without talking about Jewish freedom riders and Jack Greenberg,” he said, telling a story about seeing a group of Jewish activists at a segregated movie theater in Delaware. “You can’t talk about the women’s movement without talking about Betty Friedan” or American advances in science and technology without mentioning Einstein and Carl Sagan, or music and Gershwin, Bob Dylan and “so, so, so many other people.”\\n\\n“I believe what affects the movements in America, what affects our attitudes in America are as much the culture and the arts as anything else,” he said. That’s why he spoke out on gay marriage “apparently a little ahead of time.”\\n\\n“It wasn’t anything we legislatively did. It was ‘Will and Grace,’ it was the social media. Literally. That’s what changed peoples’ attitudes. That’s why I was so certain that the vast majority of people would embrace and rapidly embrace” gay marriage.\\n\\n“Think behind of all that, I bet you 85 percent of those changes, whether it’s in Hollywood or social media are a consequence of Jewish leaders in the industry. The influence is immense, the influence is immense. And, I might add, it is all to the good,” he said.',\n",

(Oakville, ON, CA), Wark; Ray (Halton Hills, ONT, CA)) thought this up and applied for a patent for it...which means they think it was worth patenting... which means they think there may be a market for it...and as it turns out, they may well be right: your government wants to spend your money to buy these to use on...you.\\n\\nThe people who think it\\'s a really good idea to make a device to torture airline passengers (or anyone else, for that matter) are:\\n\\n(Hmmm...what does that logo remind me of? I can\\'t quite come up with it, but there\\'s something familiar about it.)\\n\\nSome business information on them is here:\\n\\nTheir most recent SEC filings are here:\\n\\nGoogle finance has considerable information on them here:\\n\\nBusiness Week lists their executives here:\\n\\nBarry Lamperd Lamperd Less Lethal 1200 Michener Road, Sarnia, ON, Canada N7T 7H8 +1 (519) 344-4445 pinelaw@xcelco.on.ca\\n\\nMeet the president/CEO:\\n\\nOver at Prison Planet, there\\'s a must-read writeup on this: Torture Bracelet To Control Dissenting Americans? which does into more detail and explains how this could be used for a lot more than just torturing airline passengers. They\\'ve also got a pointer to the YouTube video promoting this \"product\", if I can dignify this monstrosity with that term. As Prison Planet explains:\\n\\nIntroduced ostensibly to combat airline terrorism, a creepy promo video\\n\\ncourtesy of the patent holders Lamperd FTS exploits shocking 9/11 imagery\\n\\nto push the torture device as a solution to countering potential hijackers\\n\\nby inflicting \"Electro-Muscular Disruption\" and presumably giving the\\n\\nrest of the passengers a debilitating shock at the same time.\\n\\nand\\n\\nLetters exchanged between the company and DHS official Paul S. Ruwaldt\\n\\nshow Homeland Security\\'s intention to utilize the device for border\\n\\ncontrol and, \"indeed for anywhere else for which the temporarily restraint\\n\\nof large numbers of individuals in open area environments by a small\\n\\nnumber of agents or Law Enforcement Officers\". The letters confirm that funding is being sought for the widespread\\n\\ndeployment of the device and that several state and local authorities\\n\\nhave expressed an interest, as well as the DOD, the CDC, Department of\\n\\nInterior, Department of Agriculture Forestry service as well as unnamed\\n\\nlaw enforcement agencies.\\n\\nI\\'ll get to those letters momentarily.\\n\\nThere\\'s also an excellent discussion of this torture device in one of Bruce Schneier\\'s blog entries: Wacky Airplane Security Idea, which includes these comments:\\n\\nThat\\'s a great idea--if you are hijacker. Just hack into the system and\\n\\nyou won\\'t have to worry about passengers attacking you.\\n\\nUseless idea. Any conductive foil will short the contacts and actually disable this bracelet.\\n\\nI wonder what would happen if you took it off and wrapped it around a\\n\\nleg of the seat you\\'re in? If you exposed some wire in your headphones\\n\\nand attached it to the wristband, piping the voltage into that system?\\n\\nOr if you dropped it into the toilet?\\n\\nPerfect tool for terrorists; upon boarding an aircraft, everyone is given\\n\\na high-voltage power supply sufficient for detonating a binary explosive.\\n\\nI recommend reading all of them -- many of them are quite insightful. (My idea: what would happen if this electric shock was re-routed to the plane\\'s avionics?)\\n\\nNow about the the letters from DHS: Lamperd has proudly posted PDFs of some of this correspondence on their web site:\\n\\nHere\\'s what\\'s in that last PDF:\\n\\nAs mentioned, most of the organizing for this program/project will happen within the next month, so I hope budgets will be set shortly thereafter, and then I will have a better idea on what we can do. I believe, once the extent of the funding is known and the budgets allocated, funding for the bracelet concept with the localized emitter/interrogator/restraint stations, will happen. As part of this budgetary process, could you please provide me with a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimates [sic] for the development of the system you described? In addition, assuming you were funded, could you please provide me an expected time frame/milestones as to when a prototype of such a system would be available for testing? To make it clear, we are interested in the mobile read/write emitter concept in conjunction with the immobilizing security bracelet, and look forward to receiving a written proposal. I look forward to your reply. Sincerely,\\n\\n[signature]\\n\\nPaul S.

       " ('At the End of the Day\\n\\nHeadline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!\\n\\nOnce again I am indebted to Butch the Bollocks Impaler for pointing me at some stuff over the last few days….of which, more first thing tomorrow. But this piece at the site Acting Man we found at the same time and without collusion: and it’s very good. My one observation above and beyond the excellent technicals in there is that I see the repatriation of German gold as the precursor to the beginning of the end of globalism…the ‘end of the beginning’ as Churchill would’ve said. There’s not a lot to fear from that, frankly: a return to sovereign self-sufficiency (with some trade in surpluses) is an infinitely safer and more steady route for the development of human civilisation than bonkers neocon mercantilism where the most likely outcome is nuclear obliteration.\\n\\nHowever, like it or not the latter ‘model’ currently holds sway…..and its effects continue to be obvious to those not suffering from catatonic delusion disorder.\\n\\nNpower, the Cooperative Society, Age UK and Barnardos are all trying to point out to the UK Government that the skewed age demographic we live with now dictates the certainty of older people dying of cold during the winter. Nothing Camerlot is doing at the moment, they say, goes anywhere near far enough towards avoiding this potential disgrace.\\n\\nNot surprisingly, relative laymen like me read about such things (while fainting after opening energy bills) and wonder why fuel costs are so high in a global economy currently sinking to its knees: surely supply and demand apply, we ask. Hahahahaha.\\n\\nFurther down the age scale, the cost of childcare has inflated by a massive 6% in just three months. One in four mothers at home would return to work, but the nursery costs make a nonsense of the idea. Once again we see the ‘free market’ deciding, but rather badly – and entirely in favour of greed. The childcare sector has cottoned on to the fact that babyboomers’ kids are currently sprogging bigtime as their egg quality declines…..so the nursery prices have been racked up. Doubtless Dan Hannan would approve, but the reality is that this is going to cost UKplc a great deal of entirely dead money.\\n\\nWhile they may look at first sight like two more examples of capitalism’s failure, they are not. Examples like these are airily written off by the MSM as ‘the squeezed middle syndrome’ – as if the middle might be a tiny fraction of the much bigger social franchise. The truth is, ‘the middle’ is that vast majority left over when the bottom 10% and the top 5% have been subtracted. Instances like these are symptoms of monopolistic opportunism feeding on daft feminist expectations and brainless medical intervention. They aren’t capitalism as I know it, Jim.\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nMisidentification of what’s really going on is in fact the media’s forte now, and has been for some twenty-five years or more. Nowhere has this been more apparent than in the reporting of African developments in the last year. The Algerian massacre, for example, has been written up as yet more barmy ‘Al Qeida’ religionists taking the piss, but folks like Mokhtar Belmokhtar are kidnappers – and smugglers of cigarettes and hard drugs – waging a war for survival, and access to resources, on a continent they see being invaded by Chinese and Western infidels scrabbling for the last vestiges of fuel for the globalist fire.\\n\\nBelmokhtar is an Al Qeida affiliate in the same sense that the President of the Huddersfield Town Supporters Club is a Manchester United fan. The only thing those two have in common is football: most of the time, they hate each other and barely meet to discuss anything.\\n\\nThe same media drivel applied to the branding of 2012′s north African anti-tyrant movements ‘the Arab Spring’ – imagining for some reason that Abdul in Cairo might be even remotely on the same socio-political wavelength as Dean in Brooklyn. This too is the direct descendant of Ted Levitt’s globalist crap about Parisian intellectuals being closer to Princeton intellectuals than Toulousienne or New York administrators respectively. The denial of culture is quite one of the silliest conceits of Twentieth Century Man.\\n\\nNo: the African bloodbath we are witnessing today represents an undignified and desperate attempt by the West to keep the production output/volume/multinational show on the road – by accessing vital minerals and what remains of fossil energy. It reflects the ultimate failure of Friedmanism: the unwillingness of cultural short-term greed to cede ground to rational investment into research that would render current energy modes redundant. Thus the French action in Mali is no more a defence against terrorism than Cameron’s interference in Libya was the guiding light of British democracy lending a hand: rather, they are opportunist moves to put French and British business and energy interests first.\\n\\nThe examples of this media-blindness hypothesis are myriad: the national press and the BBC incapable of looking beyond eurozone debt as the main factor lying behind the austerity being meted out to Greece. The inability to grasp that Cyprus is the Mediterranean Cuba. The unwillingness to interrogate the Erdogan regime in Turkey. The utter lack of any discerning analysis of this crazy Nazi-Soviet pact between the US and the Muslim Brotherhood. Whichever way you cut it, Geopolitics really isn’t the MSM’s strong suit.\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nWherever one looks, the Business as Usual syndrome continues to dominate. The Centre for Economic & Business Research says that house prices in the UK will hit a new peak over the next eighteen months, on the back of low interest rates, economic recovery, and a lack of quality housing stock for potential buyers. The CEBR seems not to have factored in other realities such as rock-bottom confidence, cash-strapped and paranoid banks, falling full-time employment, flatlining gdp, and the collapse of the global financial system.\\n\\nBut the Times too thinks housing will be our saviour: Economics Correspondent Kathryn Hopkins says that building 100,000 UK homes this year will create 150,000 new jobs, and thus ‘boost the economy by 1%’. Sadly, what it won’t do is export anything – or find 100,000 people with the confidence to buy the bloody things. Here yet again the media set is in awe of the building sector’s ‘cheering results’ of last week. But as The Slog showed a few days ago, the housing boom is a myth created by the smoke and mirrors that always accompany seedy deals between business and politics.\\n\\nIf this kind of thing ranks as ‘analysis’, then God help us all.\\n\\nFiled under: At the End of the Day Tagged: Cash=strapped working mothers, Freezing old people, German gold repatriation, Housing market bollocks, MSM blinkers, opportunist monopolism, The beginning of the end of gloablism\\n\\nSource:',\n",

       " ('August 18, 2016\\n\\nThe \"Wounded Boy In Orange Seat\" - Another Staged \"White Helmets\" Stunt\\n\\nThis pic is making the rounds in \"western\" media together with a tearful story from \"activists\" in a neighborhood in al-Qaeda occupied east-Aleppo.\\n\\n\\n\\nbigger\\n\\nA boy, seemingly wounded, sits quietly in a brand new, very well equipped ambulance. At a point he touches what looks like a wound on his left temple. He shows no reaction to that touch.\\n\\nThe two minute video (also here), from which the pic is taken, shows the boy being handed from the dark above to some person in a rescue jacket and carried into the ambulance. There he sits quietly, unattended, while several people take videos and pictures of him. One other kids, not obviously wounded, is then carried to the ambulance.\\n\\nAs the story is told:\\n\\nMahmoud Raslan, a photojournalist who captured the image, told the Associated Press that emergency workers and journalists tried to help the child, identified as 5-year-old Omran Daqneesh, along with his parents and his three siblings, who are 1, 6 and 11 years old. \"We were passing them from one balcony to the other,\" Raslan said, adding: \"We sent the younger children immediately to the ambulance, but the 11-year-old girl waited for her mother to be rescued. Her ankle was pinned beneath the rubble.\"\\n\\nAn internet search for \"Mahmoud Raslan\", the claimed \"photojournalist\", finds no other pictures or videos attributed to that name.\\n\\nThere are about 15 men standing around the scene and doing nothing. (Next to a \"just bombed\" site in a warzone? No fear of a double-tap strike?) At least two more men, besides the videographer, are taking pictures or videos.\\n\\nAnother kid is carried into the ambulance. In the background there is someone with a white helmet wearing a shirt of the U.S./UK financed \"White Helmets\" propaganda group.\\n\\nAn animated wounded man is walked towards the ambulance.\\n\\n\\n\\nbigger\\n\\nLike the boy, the man seems to have a wound at the upper head. But like the boy he is not bleeding at all. There is some red colored substance on his face but no blood is flowing. That is astonishing. When I rode ambulances as a first-responder, people with head wounds always bled like stuck pigs (they often messed up the car which I then had to clean). As WebMD notes:\\n\\nMinor cuts on the head often bleed heavily because the face and scalp have many blood vessels close to the surface of the skin. Although this amount of bleeding may be alarming, many times the injury is not severe ...\\n\\nThe amount of red colored substance on the boy and the man do not correspond to the amount one would expect from even a minor head wound. There are also no bandages applied or anything else that could have been used to stop an actual head wound from bleeding.\\n\\nCompare the above to this recent picture from a boy in west-Aleppo. (No \"western\" media showed this boy and his suffering. He is not on \"our side\".) The boy suffered a head wound after an improvised missile from al-Qaeda and its associates hit his neighborhood. He is in care, the bleeding has been stopped. The amount of blood on his body and soaked into his cloth is a multiple of that seen in the above pictures. The blood is also mixed with the other dirt on his face, not painted over. This looks like those patients in my ambulance. This looks real.\\n\\nAll attributes of the \"boy on orange seat\" scene and of the video are the same that can be found in dozens of \"White Helmets\" videos. It is the same theme that occurs over and over again in our picture collection Dramatic Rescue! Man With Kid Runs Towards Camera!.\\n\\nI am inclined to believe that the video above is just as staged as the other \"White Helmets\" videos and pictures. The look of the boy\\'s wound is a bit more realistic than usual but the lack of bleeding, that no one attends to the boy, his non-reaction to touching the \"wound\" and the general setting of the video scene lets me believe that it is staged.\\n\\nThis new, widely distributed propaganda item comes again at a moment where al-Qaeda and its associates in Syria are in trouble. The Russian air force is hitting them in the rear area of their attack on west-Aleppo and it is hurting them badly. A \"humanitarian ceasefire\", which can then be used to reorganize and resupply, is urgently needed. The propaganda helps to increase the pressure for such a demand.\\n\\nSome of its sponsors want the \"White Helmets\" nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. The organization itself lobbies for it on its website. Has anyone else ever done such?\\n\\n\\n\\nbigger\\n\\nHave they no shame asking themselves for the prize? This right above another version of their main corporate brand attribute, a \"Dramatic Rescue! Man With Kid Runs Towards Camera!\" picture. Asking for a Nobel right above another staged scene?\\n\\nBut why not? Obama was nothing more than a marketed product when was handed the Peace Nobel. He then bombed people in seven Muslim dominated countries to dust. There is no good reason then to not give that prize to yet another propaganda tool which also wants more war.\\n\\nThen again, I find a nomination for the Academy Awards, maybe in the category of \"Best Marketed Fakes\", more appropriate.\\n\\nPosted by b on August 18, 2016 at 01:16 PM | Permalink\\n\\nComments\\n\\nnext page »',\n",

       " ('August 20, 2011\\n\\nToronto, Ontario\\n\\nDear Friends,\\n\\nTens of thousands of Canadians have written to me in recent weeks to wish me well. I want to thank each and every one of you for your thoughtful, inspiring and often beautiful notes, cards and gifts. Your spirit and love have lit up my home, my spirit, and my determination.\\n\\nUnfortunately my treatment has not worked out as I hoped. So I am giving this letter to my partner Olivia to share with you in the circumstance in which I cannot continue.\\n\\nI recommend that Hull-Aylmer MP Nycole Turmel continue her work as our interim leader until a permanent successor is elected.\\n\\nI recommend the party hold a leadership vote as early as possible in the New Year, on approximately the same timelines as in 2003, so that our new leader has ample time to reconsolidate our team, renew our party and our program, and move forward towards the next election.\\n\\nA few additional thoughts:\\n\\nTo other Canadians who are on journeys to defeat cancer and to live their lives, I say this: please don’t be discouraged that my own journey hasn’t gone as well as I had hoped. You must not lose your own hope. Treatments and therapies have never been better in the face of this disease. You have every reason to be optimistic, determined, and focused on the future. My only other advice is to cherish every moment with those you love at every stage of your journey, as I have done this summer.\\n\\nTo the members of my party: we’ve done remarkable things together in the past eight years. It has been a privilege to lead the New Democratic Party and I am most grateful for your confidence, your support, and the endless hours of volunteer commitment you have devoted to our cause. There will be those who will try to persuade you to give up our cause. But that cause is much bigger than any one leader. Answer them by recommitting with energy and determination to our work. Remember our proud history of social justice, universal health care, public pensions and making sure no one is left behind. Let’s continue to move forward. Let’s demonstrate in everything we do in the four years before us that we are ready to serve our beloved Canada as its next government.\\n\\nTo the members of our parliamentary caucus: I have been privileged to work with each and every one of you. Our caucus meetings were always the highlight of my week. It has been my role to ask a great deal from you. And now I am going to do so again. Canadians will be closely watching you in the months to come. Colleagues, I know you will make the tens of thousands of members of our party proud of you by demonstrating the same seamless teamwork and solidarity that has earned us the confidence of millions of Canadians in the recent election.\\n\\nTo my fellow Quebecers: On May 2nd, you made an historic decision. You decided that the way to replace Canada’s Conservative federal government with something better was by working together in partnership with progressive-minded Canadians across the country. You made the right decision then; it is still the right decision today; and it will be the right decision right through to the next election, when we will succeed, together. You have elected a superb team of New Democrats to Parliament. They are going to be doing remarkable things in the years to come to make this country better for us all.\\n\\nTo young Canadians: All my life I have worked to make things better. Hope and optimism have defined my political career, and I continue to be hopeful and optimistic about Canada. Young people have been a great source of inspiration for me. I have met and talked with so many of you about your dreams, your frustrations, and your ideas for change. More and more, you are engaging in politics because you want to change things for the better. Many of you have placed your trust in our party. As my time in political life draws to a close I want to share with you my belief in your power to change this country and this world. There are great challenges before you, from the overwhelming nature of climate change to the unfairness of an economy that excludes so many from our collective wealth, and the changes necessary to build a more inclusive and generous Canada. I believe in you. Your energy, your vision, your passion for justice are exactly what this country needs today. You need to be at the heart of our economy, our political life, and our plans for the present and the future.\\n\\nAnd finally, to all Canadians: Canada is a great country, one of the hopes of the world. We can be a better one – a country of greater equality, justice, and opportunity. We can build a prosperous economy and a society that shares its benefits more fairly. We can look after our seniors. We can offer better futures for our children. We can do our part to save the world’s environment. We can restore our good name in the world. We can do all of these things because we finally have a party system at the national level where there are real choices; where your vote matters; where working for change can actually bring about change. In the months and years to come, New Democrats will put a compelling new alternative to you. My colleagues in our party are an impressive, committed team. Give them a careful hearing; consider the alternatives; and consider that we can be a better, fairer, more equal country by working together. Don’t let them tell you it can’t be done.\\n\\nMy friends, love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair. So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic. And we’ll change the world.\\n\\nAll my very best,\\n\\nJack Layton',\n",

       " ('Authored by Aaron Kesel via ActivistPost.com,\\n\\nArizona citizens are now in a government database that uses facial recognition technology to track them simply for getting a driver’s license.\\n\\nThis allows federal and local law enforcement to use the “perpetual lineup” of suspects not accused of a crime to see if someone is wanted for a crime, Arizona Capitol Times reported.\\n\\nThe state says that the program is to prevent identity theft and fraud. Here’s how it works according to Arizona Capitol Times.\\n\\nAfter someone at the Motor Vehicle Division takes your photo, your face is scanned by a system based on a proprietary algorithm that analyzes facial features. The system compares your face against the 19 million photos in the state’s driver’s license database to look for similarities. If an image is similar enough, the system will flag it for further review.\\n\\nThe program is an effort that is part of a nationwide initiative called the REAL ID Act that was created by Congress in 2005 as a response to the September 11th terror attacks. The system allows the state to comply with the federal act, which increased standards for identification documents. Although the REAL ID Act does not explicitly call for facial recognition, it does maintain that states need to take measures to reduce fraud.\\n\\nThe Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) already has publicly boasted about the success with more than 100 cases it has taken to court for fraud using the technology, which has been in place since early 2015.\\n\\nBut the use of the system to prevent identity theft isn’t what people are worried about; the problem is the lack of oversight in government programs that allows anyone with access to look into the database. As such, state-run facial recognition databases are dangerous and can lead down a slippery slope to allow other operations the technology wasn’t intended for.\\n\\nThe other key issue is the fact that residents in Arizona aren’t even being told that this is going on – coupled with the lack of oversight and disclosure, it becomes a nightmare for privacy rights advocates.\\n\\n“If you don’t know that a system is in place, you actually don’t have the choice of consenting to it or not,” said Clare Garvie who authored the “perpetual line-up” study.\\n\\nJim Dempsey, the executive director of the Berkeley Center for Law & Technology, also had some reservations about the lack of disclosure currently in effect.\\n\\nInformed consent, through giving notice to people that their faces will be matched up against millions of others when they apply for a license, is a basic tenet of privacy, Jim Dempsey, the executive director of the Berkeley Center for Law & Technology, said. Even if notice is given, it’s unlikely that people would opt out of getting a license because facial recognition technology is used because people will decide driving a car and having a legal ID outweigh the risks, Dempsey said. “It’s an important element. The lack of it is an issue, but it’s one that should be corrected and would be easy to correct,” he said.\\n\\nBoth the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) have voiced their concerns about state facial recognition databases and how this could be tied into the push by the federal government to use these databases in airports and border checkpoints creating a dystopian Orwellian surveillance state.\\n\\n“DMV photo databases are probably the most comprehensive databases in existence,” which means they’re “very, very powerful” tools for potential surveillance, something the ACLU worries could be a “next step,” Jay Stanley a senior policy analyst at ACLU said.\\n\\nOne of the main pitfalls of such a system is not only the lack of oversight on the program by any government watchdog, but the fact that there are no laws to justify the collections, or a court between law enforcement and access to millions of people’s identities.\\n\\nThe only requirement for those that search is that it must involve people suspected of committing a crime or “who law enforcement may suspect is about to commit a crime.” People could also be involved in activities that are threats to public safety, sought as part of a criminal investigation or “intelligence-gathering effort.”\\n\\nSuch extremely broad terms for using this technology is extremely worrying and has a high potential for abuse.\\n\\n“There should at the very least be a court involved before law enforcement can access millions of unwitting people’s identities,” EFF staff attorney, Adam Schwartz, said. “It’s really hard to function in a car-based society without a driver’s license, and people shouldn’t be subjected to an invasive technology when they decide to follow the law and get a legal document that allows them to drive,” he added. “It’s a misuse of data to collect data, in this case images, for one thing and use them for other purposes.”\\n\\nSchwartz added that\\n\\nin many states, including Arizona, agencies have started using facial recognition technology outside of any formal approval from the public and its representatives, state lawmakers.” “Before government starts using powerful technology to surveil the public, there ought to be a more open and transparent process where the public controls whether or not this is picked up.\\n\\nAll in all, this could set a larger precedent for the surveillance state that the DHS wants in the country under its REAL ID program.\\n\\nStates must adopt REAL ID standards by Oct. 1, 2020, or their residents will need alternate identification to travel which may include carrying a passport domestically, Daily Mail reported.',\n",

While Prime Ministers undoubtedly have a very important domestic role to play too, it’s important not to overlook the international implications of Morawiecki’s appointment, especially given what he shared in his very first interview after the announcement when he said that\\n\\n“My dream is to re-Christianize the EU since unfortunately, in many places, people no longer sing Christmas carols, the churches are empty and are turning into museums, and this is very sad.” In responding to the interviewer’s comment about how the EU might cut off funding for Poland, Morawiecki proudly said that “I do remember one former president telling us earlier this year ‘you have values, we have funds.’ Well, I would love to help the West with proper values.”\\n\\nRhetoric such as this would have been unimaginable a few years ago, but it just goes to show how far the intra-EU split has gone ever since Brussels and Berlin teamed up to pressure the bloc to accept the forced relocation of civilizationally dissimilar migrants.\\n\\nIt also speaks to the growing confidence that Poland feels nowadays in officially introducing a conservative-religious ideological vision to challenge the EU’s liberal-godless one, demonstrating how it plans to lead the “Three Seas Initiative” and advance its EuroRealist agenda. Moreover, Morawiecki’s words prove just how strongly Poland and its ruling Law & Justice Party, popularly known by its Polish abbreviation PiS, have been influenced by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his Fidesz party. Hungary may have been the ideological heart of the EuroRealist movement and Orban its first national figurehead in the EU, but Poland is now carrying the torch through Jaroslaw Kaczynski’s “grey cardinal” stewardship because this Central European country is actually big enough to make a real difference.\\n\\nIt was one thing for a landlocked nation of less than 10 million people to have this continental outlook, and another for the leader of the regional “Three Seas Initiative” and its 40 million-strong country to promote this perspective, which makes Poland an EU-wide force to be recognized because of how ideologically different its worldview is from Germany’s.\\n\\nWhereas Berlin will continue pulling the purse strings and exercising its influence through economic means, Warsaw is flexing its soft power muscle by appealing to what matters most to many of the people in Central and Eastern Europe, and that’s the national identity that they fear is under threat because of Germany’s aggressive EuroLiberalism. If Poland can succeed in winning hearts and minds in the region through its religious-conservative EuroRealist ideology, then the next natural step will be to tighten the trading bonds between its “Three Seas” partners in order to generate a stronger economic basis for turning their vision into a reality.\\n\\nWith the right combination of soft and economic power, Poland can return to becoming one of Europe’s Great Powers, but this time with a sway that extends across the strategic “Three Seas” space and enables it to shape the continent’s 21st-century geopolitics.',\n",

       " ('Authored by Antonius Aquinas,\\n\\nThe Trump Administration has presented the first part of its plan to overhaul a number of Wall Street financial regulations, many of which were enacted in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The report is in response to Executive Order 13772 in which the US Treasury Department is to provide findings “examining the United States’ financial regulatory system and detailing executive actions and regulatory changes that can be immediately undertaken to provide much-needed relief.”\\n\\nIn release of the first phase of the report, Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin stated: “Properly structuring regulation of the U.S. financial system is critical to achieve the administration’s goal of sustained economic growth and to create opportunities for all Americans to benefit from a stronger economy. We are focused on encouraging a market environment where consumers have more choices, access to capital and safe loan products – while ensuring taxpayer-funded bailouts are truly a thing of the past.”\\n\\nSome of its highlights include:\\n\\nCommunity financial institutions – banks and credit unions – are critically important to serve many Americans\\n\\nCapital, liquidity and leverage rules can be simplified to increase the flow of credit\\n\\nWe must ensure our banks are globally competitive\\n\\nImproving market liquidity is critical for the U.S. economy\\n\\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau must be reformed\\n\\nRegulations need to be better tailored, more efficient and effective\\n\\nCongress should review the organization and mandates of the independent banking regulators to improve accountability\\n\\nNot surprisingly, most of the banking industry expressed support for the report, critics (mostly Democrats) pointed out that it would lead to the type of practices that produced the 2008 panic in the first place. Both opponents and those in favor as well as the clueless financial press fail to grasp the underlying cause of not only the recent crisis, but the majority of those which have occurred for the past century.\\n\\nQuite simply: the fundamental cause of the 2008 financial crisis was fractional-reserve banking (FRB). FRB is the practice whereby banks keep a “fraction” of the funds deposited by customers in their vaults lending out the rest at interest and “profit.” Banks are thus inherently unstable since if all depositors came at once and demanded their money (a “bank run”), banks could not be able to redeem their deposits. Moreover, FRB encourages banks to engage in exceedingly speculative and risky behavior which creates unsustainable bubbles throughout the economy.\\n\\nThe nation’s central bank, the Federal Reserve, was created by the banksters and politicos to enshrine this immoral and economically ruinous practice into the heart of the American financial landscape. Any “reform” of Wall Street’s financial practices that does not address FRB by doing away with it and the institution (the Fed) which enables it to exist, is doomed.\\n\\nThe banks, in collusion with the Fed, are able to expand the money supply through this process while enriching the banksters’ balance sheet. On the macro level, the creation of money through FRB is the genesis of the destructive boom-bust cycle.\\n\\nThis is why banks and the entire financial system are so prone to reoccurring crisis and no regulation, reform, or Treasury Department “findings,” can make such a system “stable.” The only true reform is to abolish FRB and establish a monetary order that requires all financial institutions to keep 100% reserves of depositors’ assets.\\n\\nThe Treasury Department’s recommendations are mere window dressing by the very banksters whose opulent livelihoods are predicated on FRB.\\n\\nThe elimination of FRB would go beyond a beneficial financial revolution, but would affect the foreign policy of the USSA. Without the ability to create money via FRB, the murderous American Empire could simply not exist, nor would the nation’s draconian domestic security state.\\n\\nWith his selection of crony capitalists and members of Goldman Sachs to his economic team, it is apparent that President Trump does not understand the true nature of the nation’s financial woes or what precipitated the last financial crisis and what will assuredly lead to a far bigger mess down the road. If he did, his next Executive Order would be to implement steps and procedures to eliminate the scourge of fractional reserve banking forever.',\n",

       " (\"Authored by Bonner & Partners' Bill Bonner, annotated by Acting-Man's Pater Tenebrarum,\\n\\nBent and Distorted\\n\\nThis morning, we are wondering: How dumb is the Fed?\\n\\nThe question was prompted by this comment by former Fed insider Chris Whalen at The Institutional Risk Analyst blog...\\n\\n[O]ur message to the folks in Jackson Hole this week [at the annual central banker meeting there] is that the end of the Fed’s reckless experiment in social engineering via QE and near-zero interest rates will end in tears. “Momentum” stocks like Tesla, to paraphrase our friend Dani Hughes on CNBC last week, will adjust and the mother of all rotations into bonds and defensive stocks will ensue. We must wonder aloud if Chair Yellen and her colleagues on the FOMC fully understand what they have done to the US equity markets. […] Once the hopeful souls who’ve driven bellwethers such as Tesla and Amazon into the stratosphere realize that the debt driven game of stock repurchases really is over, then we’ll see a panic rotation back into fixed income and defensive stocks.\\n\\nThey’re not the best map readers, that much is known for certain. [PT]\\n\\nIf you believe the newspapers, the Fed has begun a “tightening cycle.” It is on course to raise its key interest rate, little by little, in quarter-point increments.\\n\\nIt must know that this is a perilous thing to do. After so much market manipulation over such a long period, prices all up and down the capital structure – from junk bonds to quality stocks and solid real estate – have been bent and distorted.\\n\\nAfter all, that was the idea: drive up the price of stocks and bonds by driving down interest rates. People would be forced to spend or invest their money rather than save it. And higher financial asset prices would make the rich feel even richer.\\n\\nWalking down the street, the dollars would overflow from their pockets like turnips rolling off the back of a produce truck. They’d feel so flush, they’d buy, buy, buy… sending the plain people into a flurry of trucking, toting, and busting their humps to provide them with goods and services.\\n\\nThen, after the rich were fully satiated (after all, how many martinis can the 1% drink?), they’d have to invest.\\n\\nCash would flow into money-losing start-ups like Tesla and Snapchat. Headline acquisitions, such as Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods, would keep stock prices bubbling higher. And trillions of dollars in stock buybacks would make the rich even richer still!\\n\\nWhat a wonderful work of art… the pièce de résistance of financial bubbles, the one you really had to see to believe. The red line depicts all the debt companies have amassed to grease the financial engineering wheels. This is a game that is indeed coming close to its end. US money supply and credit growth have tanked – the lagged effects of this change in the monetary backdrop will play out. We suspect that the huge surge in corporate debt will become cause for big regrets at that juncture. [PT] – click to enlarge.\\n\\nMoney Mirage\\n\\nBut the feds could only work this miracle by buying bonds. And the feds didn’t have any money. What could they do? No problem! They used their fake money, the post-1971 credit dollars – trillions of them… money they could create at will.\\n\\nFrom the post-crash bottom in 2009 to today’s top, U.S. stocks and bonds registered a cumulative increase of about $21 trillion. And upon that mirage now rest the hopes, dreams, and contentment of millions of people all over the planet.\\n\\nOne has planned his retirement based on his gains over the last eight years. Another has taken out a loan against his stocks to fund his business. Still another – a major player on Wall Street – has a billion-dollar hedge fund portfolio, a leveraged bet on “low vol,” which depends on further support from the Fed.\\n\\nAnd look at super investor Warren Buffett… the latest headline news tells us his gifts to charities now top $27 billion. The money is to be used to fight illness and poverty worldwide. But the gifts came in the form of Berkshire stock – not cash. Imagine how the halt and the hungry will suffer if the stock goes down!\\n\\nHomely Warren’s levitating gift. [PT] – click to enlarge.\\n\\nClassic Credit Bubble\\n\\nWhich brings us back to our question: How dumb is the Fed?\\n\\nAs you can see from the foregoing, the boom of 2009–17 was wrought by the Fed and paid for with fake money. It is a classic credit bubble, in other words – not genuine prosperity.\\n\\nAlmost all the new jobs created during this period were low-wage or part-time jobs in health care or government, not high-value jobs in manufacturing. That’s why real earnings, per family, have scarcely improved – and real employment (as a percentage of the available workforce) has gone down.\\n\\nAll the bubbly action, in other words, is in the financial markets, not the real Main Street economy. And as the Austrian School economists tell us, every boom not financed on real savings must end in a bust.\\n\\nPhantom wealth driver: the Fed’s electronic printing press. This orgy of money printing (TMS-2 is up more than 140% since early 2008) has driven asset prices to the stratosphere and has gone hand in hand with the explosion in outstanding debt depicted further above. Most of the “wealth” created in this manner is a mirage that will eventually disappear, one way or another. It should be clear that it is simply not possible to print an economy to “prosperity”. [PT] – click to enlarge.\\n\\nNothing comes from nothing. Fake money produces fake prosperity. Take away the fake money… and the fake prosperity goes “poof,” too. Which is why the Fed will never, voluntarily, stop manipulating prices. It can’t let the markets return to “normal” price discovery. Because the markets are likely to discover prices a lot lower than Dow 20,000.\\n\\n“Normal” may be a lot higher than a 2% yield on a 10-year Treasury yield, too. “Normal” may mean a deep depression as the economy shakes off the foolish investments and misallocations of the last eight years. “Normal” would also mean the disgrace of Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke, who are largely responsible for this bubble.\\n\\nBut “normal” won’t stop there. The crisis of 2008–09 was a repudiation of the Fed’s fake-money debt bubble. The stock market crashed as the bubble deflated, just as it normally does. But then central banks went back to work, doubling down on their error with more hot air than ever before.\\n\\nFederal debt alone almost doubled from about $10 trillion to about $20 trillion. Worldwide, $68 trillion in debt has been added since 2007 – a 45% increase – bringing the debt-to-GDP ratio to 327%.\\n\\nFederal funds rate since 1978 – the recent tightening is historically still small, but one has to keep in mind that the end of QE was a tightening move as well. It is noteworthy in this context how quickly money supply growth has declined since its last interim growth peak in November 2016. [PT] – click to enlarge.\\n\\nAll of this debt now hangs on the feeble reed of more ultra-low interest rate policies. The Fed says it is going to return its interest rate policy back to normal…\\n\\nNo chance. It’s not that dumb.\\n\\nGenerally central planners do not have much of a clue. Evidence to that effect abounds, as do sound theoretical explanations as to why it cannot be otherwise, regardless of the knowledge, intelligence or intentions of the planners. What we can state is that the Fed is reactive. Since it has embarked on a tightening path, it will probably continue until something breaks – and that could happen very soon. [PT]\",\n",

       " ('Authored by Brandon Smith via Alt-Market.com,\\n\\nThere are a few important rules you have to follow if you want to join the consortium of mainstream economic con-men/analysts. Take special note if you plan on becoming one of these very \"special\" people:\\n\\n1) Never discuss the reality that government fiscal statistics are not the true picture of the health of the economy. Just present the stats at face value to the public and quickly move on. 2) Almost always focus on false positives. Give the masses a delusional sense of recovery by pointing desperately at the few indicators that paint a rosier picture. Always mention a higher stock market as a symbol of an improving economy even though the stock market is irrelevant to the fundamentals of the economy. In fact, pretend the stock market is the ONLY thing that matters. Period. 3) Never talk about falling demand. Avoid mention of this at all costs. Instead, bring up \"rising supply\" and pretend as if demand is not a factor even worth considering. 4) Call any article that discusses the numerous and substantial negatives in the economy \"doom porn.\" Ask \"where is the collapse?\" a lot, when the collapse in fundamentals is right in front of your face. 5) Avoid debate on the health of the economy when you can, but if cornered, misrepresent the data whenever possible. Muddle the discussion with minutia and circular logic. 6) When a crash occurs, act like you had been the one warning about the danger all along. For good measure, make sure alternative economic analysts do not get credit for correct examinations of the fiscal system. 7) Argue that there was nothing special about their warnings and predictions and that \"everyone else saw it coming too;\" otherwise you might be out of a job.\\n\\nNow, if you follow these rules most of the time, or religiously, then you have a good shot at becoming the next Paul Krugman or one of the many hucksters at Forbes, Bloomberg or Reuters. A cushy job and comfortable salary await you. Good luck and Godspeed!\\n\\nHowever, say you are one of those weird people cursed with a conscience; becoming a vapid mouthpiece for the establishment may not sound very appealing. Or, maybe you just have OCD and you can\\'t stand the idea of \"creative math\" when it comes to economic data. Whatever the case may be, you want to outline the deeper facts of the economy because the economy is life — it is the structure which holds together our civilization, and if we lie about it in the short term, then we only set ourselves up for catastrophe in the long run. Welcome to another dimension. Welcome to the world of alternative economics.\\n\\nEvery aspect of the U.S. economy or the global economy can be presented two very different ways depending on whether you \"interpret\" the data to fit a preconceived conclusion, or simply relay it to the public as it really is.\\n\\nLet\\'s use oil and the petrodollar as an example...\\n\\nTo illustrate the mainstream establishment reaction to legitimate economic concerns on oil, I highly suggest going back and reading an article by Foreign Policy, the official magazine of the Council On Foreign Relations, titled \"Debunking The Dumping-The-Dollar Conspiracy,\" published in 2009. The idiocy of this article was truly bewildering at the time it was released, but even more so now in retrospect.\\n\\nFirst, it is important to note that Foreign Policy refused to even acknowledge the issue of the dollar losing petro-currency status until Robert Fisk of The Independent, someone closer to mainstream exposure, dared to broach the topic, warning that a trend was in play to dump the dollar as the petro-currency by 2018. The alternative economic community had been warning about the world moving away from U.S. oil dominance for some time beforehand.\\n\\nSecond, the CFR uses a typical circular fallacy when confronting the potential end of the dollar\\'s world reserve status; the fallacy that the dollar is the world reserve currency because \"the U.S. is the preeminent world economic power.\" Actually, the reverse is true — the U.S. is the world\\'s preeminent economic power only because the dollar has world reserve status. It was also once an industrial powerhouse after WWII, but this was ONLY because the U.S. was one of the few manufacturing hubs in the world that wasn\\'t demolished by years of kinetic destruction. When you are the only game in town, of course you reap huge economic benefits including massive international investment, but not forever.\\n\\nToday, obviously, the U.S. is far surpassed by other nations in the area of manufacturing and production, and has also been surpassed as the largest global importer and exporter. The \"preeminence\" argument is unmitigated garbage.\\n\\nThird, almost every danger Foreign Policy dismissed as \"conspiracy\" back in 2009 is now coming true. Just as Robert Fisk warned, and just as the alternative economic community warned long before him, numerous shifts in the world of oil as well as geopolitical relationships have created a spiraling nexus of anti-dollar sentiment. Is it possible that the dollar will lose petro-status by 2018? Absolutely, and here is why...\\n\\nWhile the U.S. remains the world\\'s largest oil consumer according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), American consumption of petroleum products has greatly diminished over the past few years; falling demand by increasingly destitute U.S. consumers has left oil producers searching for buyers elsewhere. The World Economic Forum noted in 2015 the drastic fall in U.S. demand since the 2008 debt crisis, but this admission went largely unnoticed in the mainstream media. Interestingly, while demand was crashing, the price per barrel continued to skyrocket because of the Federal Reserve\\'s inflationary QE policies. Almost immediately after the Fed began tapering QE, oil prices drastically declined in line with the lack of existing demand.\\n\\nIn 2017, the EIA claims there has been a rise in global demand since the second quarter. And has \"projected\" increasing demand including higher U.S. demand going into 2018, outpacing supply.\\n\\nYet, at the same time the EIA admits a frustrating stagnation in global oil demand, with the U.S. being the primary drag on consumption since 2010.\\n\\nSo, which trend are we supposed to believe? The one that is right in front of us, or the one that is optimistically projected? It is clear, even according to \"official\" statistics on crude oil imports, that the U.S. market began sinking in 2009 to levels not seen since the 1990\\'s and has not recovered since. Everyone knows that each new year is supposed to bring exponential demand, like clockwork. But this has not been the case at all in the U.S.\\n\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, China has recently surpassed the U.S. as the world\\'s largest oil importer, even though the EIA lists the U.S. as the world\\'s largest oil \"consumer.\"\\n\\nThe argument mainstream analysts would probably make here is that imports of oil are diminishing because U.S. shale oil is filling demand domestically. This argument overlooks the overall process of declining demand, though. The US is the largest consumer of oil NOW, but will that pace continue? According to the data, the answer is no. Americans are buying less petroleum products since the 2008 credit crisis, regardless of where they come from, and oil producers are seeking to diversify into other markets, and other currencies.\\n\\nOn top of that, even if it were true that imported oil is crumbling because US domestic oil is filling rising demand, this still begs the question - Why would oil producing nations stick with the dollar as the petrocurrency when the US has decided to take its ball and go home?\\n\\nThe US has now become a COMPETITOR in the oil market with shale, so why would OPEC nations and others also continue to give the US the enormous advantage of owning petrocurrency status?\\n\\nIn the meantime, the geopolitical situation grows more unstable. I believe the Iranian sanctions issue has gone ignored far too long, and this has direct repercussions on the dollar\\'s petro-status. How? Well, consider this — Europe continues its appetite for Iranian oil, with 40 percent of Iran\\'s oil exports going to the EU. With the very oddly timed U.S.-led effort by the Trump administration to renew sanctions, Europe has been caught in a catch-22; either defy sanctions and upset relations with the U.S. or lose a significant source of petroleum imports. For now it appears that the EU will support sanctions, but this time solidarity on the issue is nowhere near as strong as it was back in 2012.\\n\\nWith Iran as a major supplier for Europe as well as China, and overtaking Saudi Arabia as the top oil supplier for India, Trump\\'s latest call to put economic pressure on the nation may add more fuel to the accelerating rationale against the dollar as the primary trade mechanism for oil. The question becomes, who benefits from American influence in oil, and who suffers? The more countries that suffer because of a world reserve dollar, the more likely they will be to look for an alternative.\\n\\nChina has deepened ties to Russia for this exact reason. With Russia supplanting Saudi Arabia as China\\'s largest petroleum source, and bilateral trade between Russia and China cutting out the dollar as world reserve, this is just the beginning of the shift. In the past week it has been hinted that China will be shifting in the next two months into using its OWN currency, the Yuan, to price oil instead of using the dollar.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia, America\\'s longtime partner in the oil dominance chain, is now moving away from the old relationship. Tensions between the Saudis and the U.S. State Department over the rather surreal Qatar embargo are just part of a series of divisions. With China\\'s influence in the region increasing, the mainstream has finally begun to acknowledge that Saudi Arabia may be \"compelled\" to trade oil in currencies other than the dollar.\\n\\nWhy is oil so important? Because energy, along with currency, is the key to understanding the state of the economy. When demand for energy goes stagnant, this usually means the economy is stagnant. When a nation has maintained a monopoly on global energy trade by coupling its currency to oil, an addiction can be formed and its financial structure becomes dependent in that addiction being continuously satiated.\\n\\nForeign Policy argued in 2009 that oil trade in dollars is \"nothing more than a convention.\" I would actually agree with that in part; it is indeed a convention that can change dramatically at any given moment. But, Foreign Policy asserts that there would be no consequences for the U.S. if and when the change takes place and the dollar loses petrostatus. This is absurd. Trillions in dollars are held overseas and the singular function of those dollars is to fulfill international trade based on the \"convention\" of the dollar\\'s world reserve status. What purpose do those dollar\\'s serve if world reserve status is abandoned? The answer is none.\\n\\nAll of those dollars would come flooding back into the U.S. through various channels. Market psychology would immediately trigger a massive loss in the dollar\\'s international value, not to mention incredible inflation would be spiking here at home. This process has already begun, and it is looking more and more like the next couple of years will bring a vast \"reset\" (as the IMF likes to call it) in the hegemony of certain currencies.\\n\\nSome people believe this will be a wellspring, a change for the better. They think the death of the dollar will lead to \"decentralization\" of the global economy and a \"multipolar world,\" but the situation is far more complex than it seems. I will go into greater detail in my next article as to why the dollar and the U.S. economy in general has actually been slated for deliberate demolition and how this will likely come about.\\n\\nAs far as oil and petro-status are concerned, the mainstream media is perfectly willing to report on the developments I have mentioned here in a fleeting manner, but at the same time they are completely unwilling to account for the effects that will result or the deeper meaning behind these events. They will report on the smaller stories, but refuse to acknowledge the bigger story. It is quite a contradiction, but a contradiction with a purpose.',\n",

       " (\"Authored by Charles Hugh Smith via OfTwoMinds blog,\\n\\nWhat constitutes an impeachable offense?\\n\\nYesterday in The Internecine Deep State Conflict Moves to Stage Two I suggested that the conflict was heating up, a move confirmed by former Trump advisor Michael Flynn's guilty plea that he lied to the F.B.I. regarding his contact with Russian officials.\\n\\nThe case for impeachment now becomes clear: prosecutors will attempt to prove that Trump made contact with the Russians in violation of the Logan Act, which forbids private citizens from dealing in matters of state with foreign governments.\\n\\nAccording to the Wikipedia entry on The Logan Act, To date, only two people have ever been indicted for violating the Act's provisions. However, no person has ever been prosecuted for alleged violations of the Act.\\n\\n(There are of course other potential charges, which we will learn more about as legal commentators across the spectrum weigh in.)\\n\\nQuestion #1: can prosecutors provide evidence that shows beyond reasonable doubt that Trump violated the Logan Act before taking office?\\n\\nQuestion #2: is this an impeachable offense? That will be decided by the House of Representatives, which can pass a motion of impeachment on a simple majority: Impeachment of the president, explained.\\n\\nThe case then goes to trial in the Senate, where impeachment requires a 2/3 majority.\\n\\nClearly, impeachment is not only a legal process, it is a political process in which partisanship plays a role. The definition of what constitutes an impeachable offense is not well-defined in the Constitution, with treason and accepting bribes being two examples.\\n\\nIt's not too difficult to imagine the Supreme Court being called upon to issue a ruling, given the history of political/legal crises raising issues that must be addressed by the Supreme Court. Examples include the 2000 presidential election/ballot-counting controversy in Florida, and the 1973 Saturday Night Massacre in the Watergate scandal.\\n\\nQuestion #3: Can Trump be caught in a lie like Flynn?\\n\\nIt's common knowledge that public figures are often felled not by their initial misdeeds but by the lies and cover-ups issued to cloak the original misdeeds. If prosecutors can pin lies on Trump that are equivalent to what they pinned on Flynn, then we return to Question #2: is this an impeachable offense?\\n\\nImpeachment has been in the political winds since the 2016 election. Opinions on the likelihood and the consequences of impeachment are of course varied, for example, What’s worse than leaving Trump in office? Impeaching him. (WaPo)\\n\\nMeanwhile, stories that Trump is becoming increasingly erratic are opening another path to Trump's removal via charges of mental instability: Trump Is Cracking Up (New York Times).\\n\\nAll of which leads to Question #4: to what degree does governance grind to a halt should the crisis become the dominant focus of the nation?\\n\\nThose of us who lived through the Watergate years recall that the crisis (more a process than an event) crippled governance and policy on many levels and led to sweeping reforms of numerous federal institutions.\\n\\nQuestion #5: who benefits from the crisis, regardless of its ultimate outcome? Certainly those within the Deep State who cannot abide Trump at the head of the Executive Branch have accomplished a major goal, which is bringing legal culpability (guilty pleas, etc.) into Trump's inner circle, where maximum damage can be done, up to and including impeachment.\\n\\nAnother camp might benefit from the chaos, seeing opportunity as Trump partisans and opponents wage war on each other.\\n\\nClearly, the Trump administration has just absorbed a salvo of torpedoes, and secondary explosions are still cooking off below decks. The goal of the Deep State supporters of the administration can't be mere political survival; the goal must be to reach a resolution quickly enough to maintain some measure of consent of the governed.\\n\\nThe anti-Trump camp knows the damage done by the passage of time: the longer Trump and his circle are on the defensive, the greater the damage inflicted, even if his presidency survives more or less intact.\\n\\nIn my view, the most cogent context is not partisan politics, but the battle for the upper hand in the Deep State. Those of us on the outside of these opaque, for-all-the-marbles battles only see the shadows cast by the media circus; we are left with the unenviable task of attempting to read between the lines of scripted PR spin from every Deep State camp with a stake in the outcome, which means all of them.\\n\\nJust for reference, here is my first essay on the topic: Is the Deep State Fracturing into Disunity?

       " ('Authored by Chris Hamilton via Econimica blog,\\n\\nI hope this article brings forward important questions about the Federal Reserves role in the US and I openly admit this is by no means a comprehensive article...it simply attempts to begin a broader dialogue about the financial and economic impacts of allowing the Federal Reserve to direct America\\'s economy.\\n\\nAgainst the adamant wishes of the constitutions framers, in 1913 the Federal Reserve System was Congressionally created. According to the Fed\\'s website, \"it was created to provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable monetary and financial system.\" Although parts of the Federal Reserve System share some characteristics with private-sector entities, the Federal Reserve was supposedly established to serve the public interest.\\n\\nA quick overview; monetary policy is the Federal Reserves actions, as a central bank, to achieve three goals specified by Congress: maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates in the United States. The Federal Reserve conducts the nation\\'s monetary policy by managing the level of short-term interest rates and influencing the availability and cost of credit in the economy. Monetary policy directly affects interest rates; it indirectly affects stock prices, wealth, and currency exchange rates. Through these channels, monetary policy influences spending, investment, production, employment, and inflation in the United States.\\n\\nI suggest what truly happened in 1913 was that Congress willingly abdicated a portion of its responsibilities, and through the Federal Reserve, began a process that would undermine the functioning American democracy. How, you ask? The Fed, believing the free-market to be \"imperfect\" (aka; wrong) believed it should control and set interest rates, determine full employment, determine asset prices; not the \"free market\". And here\\'s what happened:\\n\\nFrom 1913 to 1971, an increase of $400 billion in federal debt cost $35 billion in additional annual interest payments.\\n\\nFrom 1971 to 1981, an increase of $600 billion in federal debt cost $108 billion in additional annual interest payments.\\n\\nFrom 1981 to 1997, an increase of $4.4 trillion cost $224 billion in additional annual interest payments.\\n\\nFrom 1997 to 2017, an increase of $15.2 trillion cost \"just\" $132 billion in additional annual interest payments.\\n\\nStop and read through those bullet points again... and one more time. In case that hasn\\'t sunk in, now check the chart below...\\n\\nWhat was the impact of all that debt on economic growth? The yellow line in the chart below shows the annual net impact of economic growth (in part, spurred by the spending of that new debt)...gauged by GDP (blue columns) minus the annual rise in federal government debt (red columns). When viewing the chart, the problem should be fairly apparent. GDP, subtracting the annual federal debt fueled spending, shows the US economy is collapsing except for counting the massive debt spending as \"economic growth\".\\n\\nSame as above, but a close-up from 1981 to present. Not pretty.\\n\\nConsider since 1981, the Federal Reserve set FFR % (Federal Funds rate %) is down 94% and the associated impacts on the 10yr Treasury (down 82%) and the 30yr Mortgage rate (down 77%). Four decades of cheapening the cost of servicing debt has incentivized and promoted ever greater use of debt.\\n\\nAgain, according to the Fed\\'s website, \"it was created to provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable monetary and financial system.\" However, the chart below shows the Federal Reserve policies impact on the 10yr Treasury, stocks (Wilshire 5000 representing all publicly traded US stocks), and housing to be anything but \"safer\" or \"stable\".\\n\\nPreviously, I have made it clear the asset appreciation the Fed is providing is helping a select few at the expense of the many, HERE.\\n\\nBut a functioning democratic republic is premised on a simple agreement that We (the people) will freely choose our leaders who will (among other things) compromise on how taxation is to be levied, how much tax is to be collected, and how that taxation is to be spent. The intervention of the Federal Reserve into that equation, controlling interest rates, outright purchasing assets, and plainly goosing asset prices has introduced a cancer into the nation which has now metastasized.\\n\\nIn time, Congress (& the electorate) would realize they no longer had to compromise between infinite wants and finite means. The Federal Reserves nearly four decades of interest rate reductions and a decade of asset purchases motivated the election of candidates promising ever greater government absent the higher taxation to pay for it. Surging asset prices created fast rising tax revenue. Those espousing \"fiscal conservatism\" or living within our means (among R\\'s and/or D\\'s) were simply unelectable.\\n\\nThis Congressionally created mess has culminated in the accumulation of national debt beyond our means to ever repay. As the chart below highlights, the Federal Reserve set interest rate (Fed. Funds Rate=blue line) peaked in 1981 and was continually reduced until it reached zero in 2009. The impact of lower interest rates to promote ever greater national debt creation was stupendous, rising from under $1 trillion in 1981 to nearing $21 trillion presently. However, thanks to the seemingly perpetually lower Federal Reserve provided rates, America\\'s interest rate continually declined inversely to America\\'s credit worthiness or ability to repay the debt.\\n\\nThe impact of the declining rates meant America would not be burdened with significantly rising interest payments or the much feared bond \"Armageddon\" (chart below). All the upside of spending now with none of the downside of ever paying it back or even simply paying more in interest. Politicians were able to tell their constituencies they could have it all...and anyone suggesting otherwise was plainly not in contention. Federal debt soared and soared but interest payable in dollars on that debt only gently nudged upward.\\n\\nIn 1971, the US paid $36 billion in interest on $400 billion in federal debt...a 9% APR.\\n\\nIn 1981, the US paid $142 billion on just under $1 trillion in debt...a 14% APR.\\n\\nIn 1997, the US paid $368 billion on $5.4 trillion in debt or 7% APR...and despite debt nearly doubling by 2007, annual interest payments in \\'07 were $30 billion less than a decade earlier.\\n\\nBy 2017, the US will pay out about $500 billion on nearly $21 trillion in debt...just a 2% APR.\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve began cutting its benchmark interest rates in 1981 from peak rates. Few understood that the Fed would cut rates continually over the next three decades. But by 2008, lower rates were not enough. The Federal Reserve determined to conjure money into existence and purchase $4.5 trillion in mid and long duration assets. Previous to this, the Fed has essentially held zero assets beyond short duration assets in it\\'s role to effect monetary policy. The change to hold longer duration assets was a new and different self appointed mandate to maintain and increase asset prices.\\n\\nBut why the declining interest rates and asset purchases in the first place?\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve interest rates have very simply primarily followed the population cycle and only secondarily the business cycle. What the chart below highlights is annual 25-54yr/old population growth (blue columns) versus annual change in 25-54yr/old employees (black line), set against the Federal Funds Rate (yellow line). The FFR has followed the core 25-54yr/old population growth...and the rising, then decelerating, now declining demand that represented means lower or negative rates are likely just on the horizon.\\n\\nBelow, a close-up of the above chart from 2000 to present.\\n\\nRunning out of employees??? Each time the 25-54yr/old population segment has exceeded 80% employment, economic dislocation has been dead ahead. We have just exceeded 78% but given the declining 25-54yr/old population versus rising employment...and the US is likely to again exceed 80% in 2018.\\n\\nGiven the FFR follows population growth, consider that the even broader 20-65yr/old population will essentially see population growth grind to a halt over the next two decades. This is no prediction or estimate, this population has already been born and the only variable is the level of immigration...which is falling fast due to declining illegal immigration meaning the lower Census estimate is more likely than the middle estimate.\\n\\nSo where will America\\'s population growth take place? The 65+yr/old population is set to surge.\\n\\nBut population growth will be shifting to the most elderly of the elderly...the 75+yr/old population. I outlined the problems with this previously HERE.\\n\\nBack to the Federal Reserve, consider the impact on debt creation prior and post the creation of the Federal Reserve:\\n\\n1790-1913: Debt to GDP Averaged 14%\\n\\n1913-2017: Debt to GDP Averaged 53% 1913-1981: 46% Average 1981-2000: 52% Average 2000-2017: 79% Average\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the chart below highlights, since the creation of the Federal Reserve the growth of debt (relative to growth of economic activity) has gone to levels never dreamed of by the founding fathers. In particular, the systemic surges in debt since 1981 are unlike anything ever seen prior in American history. Although the peak of debt to GDP seen in WWII may have been higher (changes in GDP calculations mean current GDP levels are likely significantly overstating economic activity), the duration and reliance upon debt was entirely tied to the war. Upon the end of the war, the economy did not rely on debt for further growth and total debt fell.\\n\\nAny suggestion that the current situation is like any America has seen previously is simply ludicrous. Consider that during WWII, debt was used to fight a war and initiate a global rebuild via the Marshall Plan...but by 1948, total federal debt had already been paid down by $19 billion or a seven percent reduction...and total debt would not exceed the 1946 high water mark again until 1957. During that \\'46 to \\'57 stretch, the economy would boom with zero federal debt growth.\\n\\n1941...Fed debt = $58 b (Debt to GDP = 44%)\\n\\n1946...Fed debt = $271 b (Debt to GDP = 119%) 1948...Fed debt = $252 b <$19b> (Debt to GDP = 92%) 1957...Fed debt = $272 b (Debt to GDP = 57%)\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the current crisis ended in 2011 (recession ended by 2010, by July of 2011 stock markets had recovered their losses), then the use of debt as a temporary stimulus should have ended?!? Instead, debt and debt to GDP are still rising.\\n\\n2007...Federal debt = $8.9 T (Debt to GDP = 62%)\\n\\n2011...Federal debt = $13.5 T (Debt to GDP = 95%)\\n\\n2017...Federal Debt = $20.5 T (Debt to GDP = 105%)\\n\\nJuly of 2011 was the great debt ceiling debate when America determined once and for all, that the federal debt was not actually debt. America had no intention to ever repay it. It was simply monetization and since the Federal Reserve was maintaining ZIRP, and all oil importers were forced to buy their oil using US dollars thanks to the Petrodollar agreement...what could go wrong?\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nBut who would continue to buy US debt if the US was addicted to monetization in order to pay its bills? Apparently, not foreigners. If we look at foreign Treasury buying, some very notable changes are apparent beginning in July of 2011:\\n\\nThe BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, S. Africa...represented in red in the chart below) ceased net accumulating US debt as of July 2011. Simultaneous to the BRICS cessation, the BLICS (Belgium, Luxembourg, Ireland, Cayman Island, Switzerland...represented in black in the chart below) stepped in to maintain the bid. Since QE ended in late 2014, foreigners have followed the Federal Reserve\\'s example and nearly forgone buying US Treasury debt.\\n\\nChina was first to opt out and began net selling US Treasuries as of August, 2011 (China in red, chart below). China has continued to run record trade driven dollar surplus but has net recycled none of that into US debt since July, 2011. China had averaged 50% of its trade surplus into Treasury debt from 2000 to July of 2011, but from August 2011 onward China stopped cold.\\n\\nAs China (and more generally the BRICS) ceased buying US Treasury debt, a strange collection of financier nations (the BLICS) suddenly became very interested in US Treasury debt. From the debt ceiling debate to the end of QE, these nations were suddenly very excited to add $700 billion in near record low yielding US debt while China net sold.\\n\\nThe chart below shows total debt issued during periods, from 1950 to present, and who accumulated the increase in outstanding Treasurys.\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve plus foreigners represented nearly 2/3rds of all demand from \\'08 through \\'14. However, since the end of QE, and that 2/3rds of demand gone...rates continue near generational lows??? Who is buying Treasury debt? According to the US Treasury, since QE ended, it is record domestic demand that is maintaining the Treasury bid. The same domestic public buying stocks at record highs and buying housing at record highs.\\n\\nLooking at who owns America\\'s debt 2007 through 2016, the chart below highlights the four groups that hold nearly 90% of the debt:\\n\\nThe combined Federal Reserve/Government Accounting Series Foreigners Domestic Mutual Funds And the massive rise in Treasury holdings by domestic \"Other Investors\" who are not domestic insurance companies, not local or state governments, not depository institutions, not pensions, not mutual funds, nor US Saving bonds.\\n\\nTreasury buying by foreigners and the Federal Reserve has collapsed since QE ended (chart below). However, the odd surge of domestic \"other investors\", Intra-Governmental GAS, and domestic mutual funds have nearly been the sole buyer preventing the US from suffering a very painful surge in interest payments on the record quantity of US Treasury debt.\\n\\nNo, this is nothing like WWII or any previous \"crisis\".\\n\\nWhile America has appointed itself \"global policeman\" and militarily outspends the rest of the world combined, America is not at war. Simply put, what we are looking at appears little different than the Madoff style Ponzi...but this time it is a state sponsored financial fraud magnitudes larger.\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve and its systematic declining interest rates to perpetuate unrealistically high rates of growth in the face of rapidly decelerating population growth have fouled the American political system, its democracy, and promoted the system that has now bankrupted the nation. And it appears that the Federal Reserve is now directing a state level fraud and farce. If it isn\\'t time to reconsider the Fed\\'s role and continued existence now, then when?',\n",

       " ('Authored by Daisy Luther via The Organic Prepper blog,\\n\\nThe Swedish government is warning its citizens to be prepared to survive on their own for at least a week, which is unusual advice for Sweden to dispense. Is there trouble on the horizon?\\n\\nShortly before Christmas, the Swedish government quietly published a paper called “Resilience.” Initially, the requirement had been for people to be prepared for 3 days without help, but it seems like that was a baby step. The government itself wants to be prepared for a 3-month long civil emergency and they’re urging citizens to take responsibility, too.\\n\\nIt really makes you wonder what is looming ahead, doesn’t it?\\n\\nA publication called SVT reported today:\\n\\n“Because we have the security policy situation we have today, we say that we will make our planning at government level to face a security crisis for three months,” says Eva-Lena Fjällström, Deputy Director of the County Administrative Board in Västerbotten. Previously, it has been said that citizens will be able to cope for three days in the event of a crisis. Now it’s extended to one week. “I think it’s important that you can manage yourself. Society has changed and is vulnerable and complex with many dependencies. It can easily be a disturbance so we have to manage ourselves, “says Eva-Lena Fjällström. (source)\\n\\nThe same publication provided video instructions for putting together a “crisis box.”\\n\\nThe Swedish government is also urging young people to get better prepared.\\n\\nIt’s also interesting to note that back in November, an article introducing the idea of preparedness was published and geared toward 18-year-olds. (One must also wonder if this is a gentle nudge toward a potential draft?) It referenced a study done to measure the preparedness levels of the country’s young people.\\n\\n“In order to strengthen Swedish emergency preparedness, it is important that as many people as possible be prepared to cope with themselves during a crisis. Therefore, it is gratifying that almost nine out of ten 18-year-olds believe that they should take responsibility for themselves and their relatives in a crisis, “says Nils Svartz, Deputy Director General at MSB. Nevertheless, the survey shows that many young people are not prepared for a crisis. Only one in three has water for three days and even fewer have prepared to communicate and receive important information from the radio if the electricity is lost. (source)\\n\\nSome Swedes will see this as a different way of life.\\n\\nThe YouTube channel Swedish Homestead (find it here) recently released a video that discussed the national government’s warning for Swedes to be prepared to handle life for at least a week without the help of the government. According to the vlogger, this is not the norm there and the government is “the Big Brother who handles everything.”\\n\\nThere were mentions of “war” and “crisis” but it appears that not many details were given as to the exact nature of the threat.\\n\\nMany people in Sweden would be incredibly vulnerable in a situation in which they were forced to be independent. Plus, an influx of migrants has to have put a further strain on resources. Nearly 20% of the population has immigrated from another country – 1.7 million people in Sweden are foreign-born in a country with a population of 9.9 million.\\n\\nSweden isn’t alone in unpreparedness\\n\\nBut wouldn’t we see the same types of issues described in the video here in America? How many Americans could go for weeks or months with the food they had on hand and the food they could produce? How many Americans make their land work for them? How many Americans have the skills to actually produce food for themselves and procure safe drinking water?\\n\\nSadly, not very many.\\n\\nJust like Sweden, many Americans are locked into a system where we are reliant on imported goods, municipal water, and a reliable transportation system to bring us supplies on a regular basis.\\n\\nWhile we may not like to think about it, a vast majority of our own population would not be able to be self-sufficient in an emergency that lasted for more than a few days.\\n\\nThe world seems to be becoming increasingly dangerous every year, with threats of nuclear devastation, petro-wars, economic collapse, and religious differences. Our own country has become rigidly divided in a right vs. left paradigm. While none of us personally can fix those issues, we CAN be prepared to take care of our own families, protect our property, and stay informed.',\n",

       " ('Authored by Darius Shatahmasebi via TheAntiMedia.org,\\n\\nOnce upon a time, the U.S. dollar was backed by the gold standard in a framework that established what was known as the Bretton-Woods agreement, made in 1944. The dollar was fixed to gold at a price of $35 an ounce, though the dollar could earn interest, marking one notable difference from gold.\\n\\nThe system ended up being short-lived, as President Richard Nixon announced that the U.S. would be abandoning the gold standard in 1971. Instead, the U.S. had other plans for the future of global markets.\\n\\nAs the Huffington Post has explained, the Nixon Administration reached a deal with Saudi Arabia:\\n\\n“The essence of the deal was that the U.S. would agree to military sales and defense of Saudi Arabia in return for all oil trade being denominated in U.S. dollars.”\\n\\nThis system became known as the Petrodollar Recycling system because countries like Saudi Arabia would have to invest excess profits back into the U.S. It didn’t take long for every single member of OPEC to start trading oil in U.S. dollars.\\n\\nA little-known economic theory, rejected by the mainstream, stipulates that Washington’s stranglehold over financial markets can be at least partially explained by the fact that all oil exports are conducted in transactions involving the U.S. dollar. This relationship between oil and currency arguably gives the dollar its value, as this paradigm requires all exporting and importing countries to maintain a certain stock of U.S. dollars, adding to the dollar’s value. As Foreign Policy – a magazine that rejects the theory – explains:\\n\\n“It does matter slightly that the trade typically takes place in dollars. This means that those wishing to buy oil must acquire dollars to buy the oil, which increases the demand for dollars in world financial markets.”\\n\\nThe term “those wishing to buy oil” encompasses almost every single country that does not have an oil supply of its own – hardly a trivial number. An endless demand for dollars means an endless supply, and the United States can print as much paper as it wants to account for its imperial ambitions. No other country in the world can do this.\\n\\nIn 2000, Iraq announced it would no longer use U.S. dollars to sell oil on the global market. It adopted the euro, instead, which was no easy decision to make. However, by February 2003, the Guardian reported that Iraq had netted a “handsome profit” after making this policy change.\\n\\nAnyone who rejects this petrodollar theory should be able to answer the following question: if currency is not an important factor in America’s imperialist adventures, why was the U.S. so intent on invading a country (based on cold, hard lies), only to make it a priority to switch the sale of oil back to dollars? If they cared so much about Iraq and its people, as we were supposed to have believed, why not allow Iraq to continue netting a “handsome profit”?\\n\\nIn Libya, Muammar Gaddafi was punished for a similar proposal that would have created a unified African currency backed by gold, which would have been used to buy and sell African oil. Hillary Clinton’s leaked emails confirmed this was the main reason Gaddafi was overthrown, though commentators continue to ignore and reject the theory. Despite these denials, Clinton’s leaked emails made it clear that Gaddafi’s plan for the future of African oil exports was a priority for the U.S. and its NATO cohorts, more so than Gaddafi’s alleged human rights abuses. This is the same Hillary Clinton who openly laughed when Gaddafi was sodomized and murdered, displaying no regrets that she single-handedly plunged a very rich and prosperous nation into a complete state of chaos.\\n\\nAt the start of this month, Venezuela announced it would soon “free” itself from the dollar. Barely a week or so later, the Wall Street Journal reported that Venezuela had stopped accepting dollars for oil payments in response to U.S. sanctions. Venezuela sits on the world’s largest oil reserves. Donald Trump’s threats of unilateral military intervention — combined with the CIA’s admission that it will interfere in the oil-rich country — may make a lot more sense in this context.\\n\\nIran has also been using alternative currencies — like the Chinese yuan — for some time now. It also shares a lucrative gas field with Qatar, which could be days away from ditching the dollar, as well. Qatar has reportedly already been conducting billions of dollars’ worth of transactions in the yuan. Just recently, Qatar and Iran restored full diplomatic relations in a complete snub to the U.S. and its allies. It is no surprise, then, that both countries have been vilified on the international stage, particularly under the Trump administration.\\n\\nIn the latest dig to the U.S. dollar and global financial hegemony, the Times of Israel reported that a Chinese state-owned investment firm has provided a $10 billion credit line to Iranian banks, which will specifically use yuan and euros to bypass U.S.-led sanctions.\\n\\nConsider that in August 2015, then-Secretary of State John Kerry warned that if the U.S. walked away from the nuclear deal with Iran and forced its allies to comply with U.S.-led sanctions, it would be a “recipe, very quickly…for the American dollar to cease to be the reserve currency of the world.”\\n\\nIran, bound to Syria by a mutual-defense pact, was reportedly working to establish a natural gas pipeline that would run through Iraq and Syria with the aim of exporting gas to European markets, cutting off Washington and its allies completely. This was, of course, in 2009 — before the Syrian war began. Such a pipeline deal, now with Russia’s continued air support and military presence, could entail the emergence of a whole new market that could easily be linked to the euro, or any other currency for that matter, instead of the dollar.\\n\\nAccording to Russian state-owned outlet RT, the Kremlin’s website announced Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has also instructed the government to approve legislation to ditch the U.S. dollar at all Russian seaports by next year.\\n\\nFurther, the Asia Times explains that Putin dropped an enormous “bombshell” at the recent BRICS summit in Xiamen early September, stating:\\n\\n“Russia shares the BRICS countries’ concerns over the unfairness of the global financial and economic architecture, which does not give due regard to the growing weight of the emerging economies. We are ready to work together with our partners to promote international financial regulation reforms and to overcome the excessive domination of the limited number of reserve currencies.” [emphasis added]\\n\\nAccording to the Asia Times author, the statement was code-speak for how BRICS countries will look to bypass the U.S. dollar as well as the petrodollar.\\n\\nChina is also on board with this proposal. Soon, China will launch a crude oil futures contract priced in Chinese yuan that will be completely convertible into gold. As reported by the Nikkei Asian Review, analysts have called this move a “game-changer” for the oil industry.\\n\\nBoth Russia and China have been buying up huge quantities of gold for some time now. Russia’s present gold reserves would back 27 percent of the narrow ruble money supply – far in excess of any other major country. The United States’ Federal Reserve admitted years ago that they haven’t held any gold for a very long time.\\n\\nChina is also implementing a monumental project, known as the Silk Road project, which is a major push to create a permanent trade route connecting China, Africa, and Europe. One must wonder much control over these transactions will the U.S. have.\\n\\nThese are just a few of the latest developments that have affected the dollar.\\n\\nCan those continue to reject this petrodollar-related theory answer the following questions with confidence: Is it a coincidence that all of the countries listed above as moving away from the dollar are long-time adversaries of the United States, including the ones that were invaded? Is it a coincidence that Saudi Arabia gets a free pass to commit a host of criminal actions as it complies with the global financial order? Are Saudi Arabia’s concerns with Qatar really rooted in the latter’s alleged funding of terror groups even though Saudi Arabia leads the world in funding the world’s most vile terror groups?\\n\\nClearly, there is something far more sinister at play here, and whether or not it is tied solely to a deranged, psychopathic currency warfare will remain to be seen. The evidence continues to show, however, that the U.S. dollar is slowly being eroded piece by piece and ounce by ounce — and that as these adversarial countries make these developments in unison, there appears to be little the U.S. can do without risking an all-out world war.',\n",

       " ('Authored by Duane Norman via Free Market Shooter,\\n\\nTesla proponents love to remind people how their vehicles are “carbon free” (in spite of Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s own carbon profligate lifestyle):\\n\\nFact: the Tesla Model S is an environmentally friendly, zero emissions electric vehicle that won’t pollute the air like gas-powered cars. Carbon emissions from a gas car’s tailpipe has a dangerous impact on global warming…. In addition, Tesla CEO Elon Musk explains that, “combustion cars emit toxic gases. According to an MIT study, there are 53,000 deaths per year in the U.S. alone from auto emissions.”\\n\\nBut in reminding people about how they don’t burn fossil fuels, they make sure to omit and/or obfuscate all the other emissions-laden factors that go into production of Tesla automobiles, including the oft-unspoken costs of the vehicles to the taxpayer and to other auto manufacturers.\\n\\nStart with the power source for the Tesla; their electric power plant uses lithium-ion batteries to store the electricity required to run the car. And while a good amount of lithium is produced at salt lake brines that use chemical processes to extract the requisite lithium…\\n\\n…a large (and growing) amount of lithium is sourced from hard-rock mining, which is also referred to as strip mining:\\n\\nThis type of mining involves not just all the carbon used to extract the lithium from mines, it “strips” the land of its forests, which is far more environmentally (and carbon) detrimental. And while it is likely impossible to know exactly where Tesla sources its materials from, a closer examination on Tesla’s impact on the mining industry should paint a crystal clear picture:\\n\\nShould the concept capture the imagination of Americans who are increasingly conscious of reducing their carbon footprint demand for these crucial elements could skyrocket in addition to the already robust global demand for lithium, nickel and copper. Major mining companies are already “future proofing” their businesses for climate change by focusing more investment into commodities that will be required by the renewable energy industry.\\n\\nYou can’t make this stuff up – Tesla and other renewable energy industries are going to save the world by mining its natural resources to excess, without regard for the environmental impact and carbon emissions generated in the process. You shouldn’t be surprised to seldom hear this mentioned by Elon Musk, or the liberal crowd that champions electric vehicles.\\n\\nIt’s hardly the only way Tesla’s manufacturing process is anything but emissions-free. Just take a look at their factory:\\n\\nEven TreeHugger.com, of all places, muses at the irony of the Tesla plant:\\n\\nThe factory is in the middle of nowhere, really — 23 miles from the nearest city of any size, Reno, Nevada. If we assume that this is the average distance workers are commuting (and it is likely a lot farther), that the cars are powered by gasoline, and that they are average size, then according to the EPA they pump out about 411 grams of CO2 per mile or 18.9 kilograms per round trip. Multiply that by 3,000 and you have 57 tonnes of CO2 generated every day just by the the workers driving to the factory. The average car puts out 4.7 tonnes per year. So every day that the Gigafactory workers drive to work to make batteries for carbon-saving electric cars, they generate as much CO2 as 12 conventional cars do in a year.\\n\\nAnd though no one should put it past Tesla to source power for its plant via a “renewable” source, would you really be surprised to find some fossil fuel powered machinery in the plant, given Musk’s own callous attitude towards carbon emissions when it comes to space launches and his own private flights?\\n\\nNone of this even mentions the tax incentives Tesla receives. Electric vehicles are subsidized by the federal government via a tax credit, which is no small chunk of change; $7,500, to be exact:\\n\\nThe federal incentive to purchase an electric vehicle comes in the form of a $7,500 tax credit. In order to qualify for this credit, one must have a tax burden of at least $7,500 and take ownership of a newly purchased electric car before the vehicle manufacturer reaches its 200,000th EV sold in the U.S.\\n\\nSince Tesla has not sold 200,000 vehicles in the US, the tax credit is still alive and well. Which means that if you say the average sticker price of a Tesla is $100,000 (still high according to estimates), the federal government is subsidizing 7.5% of the purchase price.\\n\\nAnd that is before you even count the “Zero-Emission Vehicle” (ZEV) credits that Tesla makes a mint on. Bloomberg explained exactly how important these are to Tesla:\\n\\nI’m referring to zero-emission vehicle, or ZEV, credits. California and several other states require that a certain proportion of the vehicles sold by an automaker emit no greenhouse gases. These cars earn the automaker credits, and if they don’t have enough to meet their quota, they can buy extra ones from someone who does. As Tesla only makes vehicles that run on batteries and emit nothing, it usually has a surplus for sale. The profit margin on these is very high, perhaps 95 percent. The implied $95 million of profit equates to about 58 cents a share. Tesla reported a loss of $1.33 per share this week — beating the consensus forecast by 55 cents.\\n\\nSo Tesla earns a subsidy not just from the American taxpayer, it earns a subsidy from all the auto companies that are forced to buy ZEV credits from Tesla in states (primarily California) that force ZEVs upon automakers. And somehow, Tesla still spends more money than it takes in.\\n\\nThat’s correct; in spite of the massive subsidies it receives to operate, Tesla is not even profit-neutral, and the cars are not carbon-neutral, despite what the proponents will have you believe. Of course, none of this even factors in the carbon impact of whatever electricity source Tesla owners charge their cars with, which is a topic you could write a whole ‘nother article on.\\n\\nTesla cars are subsidized using a business model that is anything but “dollar-neutral”, and they are built and operated using anything but a “carbon-neutral” process . Can you imagine what could happen if the subsidy “plug” was pulled?\\n\\nNote: What would be a “solution” for the “climate change” crowd to push that would actually be honest? Look no further than the aforementioned TreeHugger.com to fill you in:\\n\\nNothing has changed, which is why this TreeHugger will continue being critical of any kind of car, and will continue to promote walkable cities, bicycles and public transport as the real solutions to the problem of decarbonizing our society.\\n\\n“Decarbonizing” our society obviously isn’t something I believe in, so don’t expect me to join Lloyd Alter in his carbon-free city. However, I acknowledge that he’s at the very least participating in an intellectually honest discussion about CO2, and not grandstanding about how much he’s helping the environment by plopping himself behind the wheel of a Tesla.',\n",

       " (\"Authored by Economic Prism's MN Gordon via Acting-Man.com,\\n\\nPast the Point of No Return\\n\\nAdventures in depravity are nearly always confronted with the unpleasant reality that stopping the degeneracy is much more difficult than starting it. This realization, and the unsettling feeling that comes with it, usually surfaces just after passing the point of no return. That’s when the cucumber has pickled over and the prospect of turning back is no longer an option.\\n\\nDepravity and bedlam through the ages. The blue barge of perdition in the lower middle ferries the depraved and degenerate to their final destination, a small slice of which can be glimpsed above… [PT]\\n\\nIn late November 2008, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke put in place a fait accompli. But he didn’t recognize it at the time. For he was blinded by his myopic prejudices.\\n\\nBernanke, a self-fancied Great Depression history buff with the highest academic credentials, gazed back 80 years, observed several credit market parallels, and then made a preconceived diagnosis. After that, he picked up his copy of A Monetary History of the United States by Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, turned to the chapter on the Great Depression, and got to work expanding the Fed’s balance sheet.\\n\\nNow here is something all those “Great Depression experts” always neglect to mention: the Fed’s holdings of government securities expanded my more than 400% between late 1929 and early 1933. Friedman’s often repeated assertion that the Fed “didn’t pump enough” in the early 1930s – which is held up as the gospel truth by nearly everyone – is simply untrue. It is true that the money supply collapsed anyway – but not because the Fed didn’t try to pump it up. Many contingent circumstances mitigated against money supply expansion: too many banks went bankrupt, taking all their uncovered deposit money to money heaven, as there was no FDIC insurance; only 50% of all banks were even members of the Federal Reserve system; no-one wanted to borrow or lend in view of the massive economic contraction and the Hoover administration’s ill-conceived interventionism. We can also tentatively conclude that the economy’s pool of real funding was under great pressure, which was exacerbated as a result of the trade war triggered by the protectionist Smoot-Hawley tariff enacted in June 1930. The collapse in international trade and investment meant that the pool of savings of the rest of the globe was no longer accessible. [PT]\\n\\nBernanke’s dirty deed commenced with the purchase of $600 billion in mortgage-backed securities, using digital monetary credits conjured up from thin air. By March 2009, he’d run up the Fed’s balance sheet from $900 billion to $1.75 trillion. Then, over the next five years, he ballooned it out to $4.5 trillion.\\n\\nAll the while, Bernanke flattered his ego with platitudes that he was preventing Great Depression II. Did it ever occur to him he was merely postponing a much-needed financial liquidation and rebalancing? Did he comprehend that his actions were distorting the economy further and setting it up for an even greater bust?\\n\\nUS broad true money supply TMS-2 and assets held by the Federal Reserve… and the perpetrator seen through the lens of various observers. [PT] – click to enlarge.\\n\\nNormalization Principles and Plans\\n\\nPerhaps Bernanke understood exactly what he was doing. As many readers have insisted over the years, the Fed works for the big banks and big money interests. Not Main Street. Regardless, the Fed recognizes that the optics of its $4.5 trillion balance sheet have become a bit skewed. The Great Recession officially ended over eight years ago. Why is the Fed’s balance sheet still extremely bloated?\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Fed Chair Janet Yellen attempted to clarify what the Fed is going to do about it. Following the two day Federal Open Market Committee meeting, the Fed issued its customary statement. Therein, it mentioned that balance sheet normalization would be initiated in October. The referenced implementation note offered details on how the Fed will go about contracting its balance sheet:\\n\\n“Effective in October 2017, the Committee directs the [Open Market] Desk to roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each calendar month that exceeds $6 billion, and to reinvest in agency mortgage-backed securities the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each calendar month that exceeds $4 billion.”\\n\\nMs. Yellen mentioned that the run-down of the balance sheet was going to be akin to “watching paint dry” – this is certainly true, considering its current size of around $4.5 trillion and the relatively small initial monthly drawdowns of $10 billion. But reductions by $50 billion per month are quite sizable and the markets are very likely to anticipate the effects at some point. In other words, this exercise in quantitative tightening could get a lot more exciting rather sooner than expected. [PT]\\n\\nMoreover, if we correctly interpreted the Fed’s June 2017 Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, the Fed plans to increase this initial $10 billion balance sheet contraction every three months by increments of $10 billion until they reach $50 billion per month. Then they’ll let it ride until they’re back to normal; though, it is unclear what the Fed believes normal is. What to make of it?\\n\\nJanet Yellen’s 78-Month Plan for the National Monetary Policy of the United States\\n\\nBy our back of the napkin calculation, starting with October’s initial $10 billion reduction, then incrementally increasing the reduction by $10 billion each quarter until hitting $50 billion per month, and then contracting by $50 billion a month from there, it will take 78-months for the Fed to get its balance sheet back to $900 billion (i.e., where it was before Bernanke’s act of depravity). Thus, in roughly six and a half years, or in March 2024, monetary policy will be back to normal.\\n\\nIf you recall, the Soviets operated under five-year plans for the development of the national economy of the USSR. Now, Yellen, an ardent central planner and control freak, has charted the Fed’s 78-month plan for the national monetary policy of the United States. Have you ever heard of something so ridiculous?\\n\\nHowever, while the Soviets were zealous believers in their plans, we suspect the Fed will be as committed to the cause as a fat person to a New Year’s Day diet. In truth, the Fed will never, ever reduce its balance sheet to $900 billion. They won’t even get close; they are well past the point of no return.\\n\\nIn the early 1930s the Soviet planners under Stalin had a great idea: why not fulfill the 5 year plan in four years? This showed that nothing was impossible for the “new Soviet man” and two plus two was henceforth five. As Marxists will explain, this is in perfect keeping with the rules of polylogism. Even the laws of mathematics must bend to proletarian logic. [PT]\\n\\nFor starters, financial markets will not allow the Fed to execute its 78-month tightening program according to plan. At some point, credit markets will have a severe reaction. This would ripple through stock markets and nearly all assets that are propped up by cheap credit.\\n\\nWhat’s more, if this doesn’t panic the Fed from its master 78-month monetary policy plan, the economy will. No doubt, at some point within the next 78-months the U.S. economy will shrink. What will the Fed do then? Will they continue to tighten in the face of a contracting economy?\\n\\nGuess who’s lying in wait… it will be found out that a creature long held to be extinct was merely hibernating in its cave, sharpening its claws. [PT]\\n\\nNo way. They will ease, and then they will ease some more. They won’t stop until it is near impossible for an honest person to work hard, save their money, and pay their way in life. Many fine fellows were already pickled over by the Fed in the last easing cycle and lost their way. More are bound to follow.\",\n",

Among other things, the memo shows that 33 years before the Agency declared WikiLeaks a hostile non-state intelligence service, they were viewing the general press in the same terms.\\n\\nSeveral weeks prior, CIA Director Casey had asked the IG to weigh in on officer Eloise Page’s paper on unauthorized disclosure. The IG passed the task onto someone on his staff, who produced a four page SECRET memo for IG James Taylor, who passed it onto Director Casey.\\n\\nThe IG specifically endorsed the proposal for a program where the Agency would intervene with journalism schools , which is discussed further below.\\n\\nThe SECRET memo began by endorsing the proposals that Page had laid out in her paper. Specifically praised among her proposed initiative was new legislation, a special FBI unit, and a special prosecutor. While it was obviously hoped that this would help enforce the law, the member of the IG staff also hoped that they would create a chilling effect. The sole criticism for Page’s paper was that it lacked a strategy for dealing with the media, who were the “principal villains” in all of this.\\n\\nTo the Inspector General’s office, the reason that the press were the “principal villains” was simple: “absolute power corrupts absolutely” and “the power of the media to publish in this country is nearly absolute.” As a result of the media’s “absolute power”, argued the Agency that had been involved in mind control attempts, illegal surveillance, tampering in foreign elections and dozens of assassinations, assassination attempts and coups, they had been corrupted absolutely. The member of the IG’s staff then suggested that they compare the media to the “opposition,” a reference to hostile intelligence services. This could be backed up by citing “precise parallels in methods and results, if not in motivations, between the media’s attempts to penetrate us and the opposition’s attempts to do the same.”\\n\\nThe IG’s office argued that the Agency’s response to the media had been largely passive and inadequate. Proposing that it was “time for an offense as well as a defense”, they offered a list of potential Do’s and Don’ts for the Agency.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, they argued that the Agency shouldn’t “frontally attack” concepts such as the First Amendment and freedom of the press. Nor should any program to curb media excesses be announced. While they had praised Page’s suggestion of new legislation, they also argued that the Agency shouldn’t expect anything to materialize. Nor should they expect help from Congress on covert action - it was simply “too easy to argue there’s a public interest in debating actions that could lead to war.” Instead, the Agency should remember that journalists don’t operate in a vacuum and their support/publishing structure can be prevailed upon as a method of tempering a journalist’s activities - especially since the press had “their own reasons for wanting to improve [their] image.”\\n\\nThe list of Do’s was significantly longer, beginning with several self-explanatory suggestions and a call for releasing “a sanitized list of foolish media disclosure that have cost the country or individuals substantially.” The second half of that suggestion remains redacted, marked as exempt from disclosure lest it reveal some of the Agency’s sources or methods.\\n\\nThe list of Do’s also included using the Agency’s official contacts “in leadership posts” for academia and the media. There were “undoubtedly” similar unofficial contacts that could also be prevailed upon.\\n\\nA later suggestion similarly pointed out that “the media have owners, Boards of Directors, managing editors et al” and that the Agency “had some success for a while in staving off” something, the details of which remain redacting allegedly to protect the Agency’s sources and methods.\\n\\nThe penultimate suggestion put forward by the IG’s office was that the Agency should figure out just what media ethics reviews and processes existed, and “try to get such people to address the issues that concern us.” That finding out and using proper channels needed to be suggested as a new strategy to pursue is mildly alarming.\\n\\nThe final suggestion, which was specifically praised by the IG when presenting the memo to the CIA Director, was using Agency contacts with college and university presidents at schools of journalism to change their curriculums. The hope was that this might challenge or put an end “to the practice of publishing indiscriminately whatever an investigative reporter can come up with.” The IG seemed taken with the idea that “given some curriculum changes, the next generation of reporters might show some elevation of ethics.”\\n\\nThe CIA Director passed the memo to Clair George, the Agency official responsible for liaising with Congress who would later be convicted of lying to Congress.\\n\\nYou read the exchange of memos here.\\n\\nIs it any wonder that the CIA is now terrified of the non-mainstream media, that is outside of their control?',\n",

       " ('Authored by Huw van Steenis via The Financial Times,\\n\\nHarnessing blockchain will be just one chapter of a dense book at Davos\\n\\nBitcoin and blockchain are likely to dominate discussions at Davos this month. But there will be a far deeper deliberation about the wider disruptive impact of technology on banks.\\n\\nFinanciers used to think that the post-crisis regulatory burden would make financial services less appealing for new entrants. But now they fear that non-banking rivals may target more profitable areas and skim the cream in areas such as payments or lending. Central banks are concerned too. The Bank of England recently war-gamed the impact of fintech on banks’ business models for the first time in their stress tests, suggesting UK banks could lose £1bn of profits to new competitors.\\n\\nThe picture is changing fast, with US deregulation and the finalisation of the Basel rules. Banks have had to focus on repair and new rules since the crisis, soaking up their change-the-business technology budgets. Now, they can potentially free up resources to focus on maximising the potential of technology\\n\\nA more intense focus by banks on potential disruption has four big implications.\\n\\nFirst, banks will step up their spending considerably. According to IDC, only about a quarter of US bank technology budgets is spent on digital transformation, as opposed to business as usual. They expect this to grow to nearer 40 per cent in 2020. This implies a more than doubling of transformation expenditure over the coming four years. There will be deep seams of opportunities to mine. For instance, cyber risk is currently viewed as the greatest risk to the financial system by the Basel Committee. Tech firms and consortiums which help detect fraud, solve authentication and the protection of data from cyber risks will flourish. Secondly, this spending could substantially boost banks’ productivity, and profits. I took a straw poll of executives from a range of firms in the World Economic Forum’s disruptive innovation in financial services group. This suggested they are looking to automate up to one-third of all of their activities in the coming four years — and 2018 is likely to be pivotal for blockchain as pilots, such as at the Australian Stock Exchange, get the green light. Cryptocurrencies will capture the imagination of users and fears of policymakers. But harnessing blockchain will be just one chapter of a dense book. I suspect how banks use machine learning and rudimentary artificial intelligence to improve customer experience, nudge sales or improve efficiency will have a larger impact on the bottom line than blockchain in the next five years. But with Big Data comes Big Noise: companies will also need help to structure, manage and analyse the new data to use them effectively. Those banks that embrace innovation could have a productivity dividend and mitigate the risk of disruption. Thirdly, the battle for customers will get far more intense, making it more challenging for start-ups looking to build consumer brands. The battle between every start-up and financial institution comes down to whether the start-up gets distribution before the incumbent gets innovation, as venture capitalist Alex Rampell likes to say. Banks will drive up the cost of customer acquisition for start-ups who will increasingly struggle unless they build network effects and scale very quickly. Roboadvisers and peer-to-peer lenders will be on heightened alert. Some start-ups will need to rethink their plans to disrupt and look to form partnerships instead. Finally, the biggest fear is whether banks, or other financials, may get Amazon-ed. A recent WEF report suggested that finance is more likely to be upended not by nimble fintech start-ups but by established big tech firms encroaching. Changes in financial regulation, such as a lighter touch fintech charter being examined in the US or the second payment services directive in Europe, could potentially make this more likely. The tech giants have the brands, customer reach, digital processes and flair to develop good products, and to take swift advantage of any regulatory changes. A recent survey by Bain across 22 countries suggested customers are open to potentially buying financial products from tech firms, leaving banks vulnerable. In China, leading technology firms have already moved into banking and insurance at scale. Ant Financial, part of Alibaba, is already as big as the ninth-largest US bank.\\n\\nWhile central bankers fret about bitcoin, this is what financiers will really be discussing this year.',\n",

In fact, 2% inflation cuts the purchasing power of the dollar by 75% in the course of an average lifetime. The Fed would tell you to ignore that.\\n\\nWhy 2% inflation is considered “price stability” is a subject for another day. For now, let’s just accept the Fed’s definition and see how the Fed responds from a policy perspective.\\n\\nThe Fed carves out food and energy prices from inflation. That gets to something called “core” inflation.\\n\\nThe Fed’s preferred metric is calculated monthly by the U.S. Commerce Department as the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator. The Fed’s preferred interval is monthly data compared to the same month one year earlier, or “year-over-year,” YOY.\\n\\nWith a 2% target for PCE core YOY, what’s the actual time series of data? Here it is:\\n\\nDecember 2016: 1.9%\\n\\nJanuary 2017: 1.9%\\n\\nFebruary 2017: 1.9%\\n\\nMarch 2017: 1.6%\\n\\nApril 2017: 1.6%\\n\\nMay 2017: 1.5%\\n\\nJune 2017: 1.5%\\n\\nJuly 2017: 1.4%\\n\\nAugust 2017: 1.3%\\n\\nAn objective analyst would give the Fed credit for coming close to their target in late 2016. This is precisely why the Fed embarked on a path of rate hikes. The Fed raised interest rates in December 2016, March 2017 and June 2017.\\n\\nThe chart below is taken from a presentation given by Janet Yellen on September 26, 2017. The black horizontal line is the Fed’s 2% inflation target. The blue line represents actual PCE inflation; the red line represents PCE “core” inflation with food and energy prices removed, (the Fed’s preferred method). The downward trajectory of the red line should be disturbing to the Fed, but is routinely dismissed as “transitory.”\\n\\nWhat happened next?\\n\\nTo answer that question, bear in mind that monetary policy works with a lag. That insight is one of Milton Friedman’s few economic contributions that has stood the test of time.\\n\\nThe Fed has been tightening in fits and starts since Bernanke’s “taper talk” in May 2013. This has resulted a consistent pattern in which Fed tightening slows the economy, then the Fed flips to ease, and the economy picks up steam, which leads to another round of tightening, and another slowdown.\\n\\nWash, rinse, repeat.\\n\\nThe Fed’s late 2016, early 2017 tightening cycle has now come home to roost. In the latest nine-month time series, shown above in the table and chart, inflation was flat or down in every month, and dropped a total of 0.6%.\\n\\nThat’s huge. The Fed’s range for this purpose is 0% to 2%. The floor is 0% because the Fed must avoid deflation. The ceiling is 2% because that’s the Fed’s announced target. A 0.6% drop covers 30% of the target range. It’s a quite significant move, and all in the wrong direction.\\n\\nWhat’s Yellen’s reaction to this in-your-face data? In effect, she says. “It’s transitory!”\\n\\nFirst Yellen blamed a price war among cell phone service providers. Then she blamed the strong dollar, which tends to lower import prices (with a strong dollar you get more for your money abroad so unit costs decline).\\n\\nThen she blamed health care costs because they’re government administered and not responsive to Fed monetary policy. Then she blamed hurricane damage from Harvey, Irma and Maria.\\n\\nIt’s always something.\\n\\nWhy are Yellen and her colleagues in denial about the persistence of disinflation? Why are they insisting that an obvious trend is merely “transitory?”\\n\\nThe first analytic flaw is Yellen’s belief in the Phillips Curve. This model presents an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. As unemployment goes down, labor scarcity leads to wage increases above growth potential. This leads to inflation.\\n\\nThe Fed assumes that because of low unemployment today, inflation must be right around the corner.\\n\\nThe only problem with the Phillips Curve is that it does not exist. It has no empirical support. In the late 1970s and early 1980s we had high unemployment and high inflation. Today we have low unemployment and low inflation. Both results are the exact opposite of what the Phillips Curve would predict.\\n\\nYellen also believes that monetary ease, acting with a lag, feeds inflation. Therefore it is necessary to tighten policy before inflation arrives in order to avoid getting behind the curve.\\n\\nMonetary policy does act with a lag, but it does not directly cause inflation. It may add fuel to a fire, but it’s not the catalyst. The Fed has created $3.5 trillion of new money since 2008, yet there has been no appreciable amount of inflation for nine years.\\n\\nThe cause of inflation is not money supply but psychology. It is expressed as velocity — the speed at which money is turned over through lending and spending. Velocity depends on behavioral psychology, or what Keynes called “animal spirits,” regardless of the amount of money around.\\n\\nYellen sees inflation under every rock despite the lack of empirical evidence. In fact, the evidence as revealed in the time series of PCE data above points toward disinflation and deflation.\\n\\nReality is catching up with the Fed.\\n\\nThey will respond by taking a “pause” on an interest rate hike in December. This is the opposite of current market expectations.\\n\\nWhat about the prospects for disinflation and Fed easing?\\n\\nThe most important development is recent strength in the U.S. dollar. This has the effect of lowering import prices, which feeds into the U.S. manufacturing supply chain. Cheaper imports also put a lid on the ability of competing U.S. producers to raise their own prices.\\n\\nSecond, the September employment report came out last Friday. A Reuters survey of economists had expected the economy to add 90,000 jobs in September.\\n\\nHow many did it really add?\\n\\nZero. Less than zero, actually. The economy shed 33,000 jobs. This was the first time in seven years that the U.S. economy lost jobs.\\n\\nThis may be due to the hurricanes, but coming on top of the weak inflation data that came out recently, it will certainly give the Fed more than enough reason to hit the “pause” button on a December rate hike.\\n\\nFinally, Yellen’s term as Chair expires at the end of January 2018, just a few months away . It appears she will not be reappointed by Trump. The current favorite to replace her is Kevin Warsh, as I told readers my earlier this year.\\n\\nThe December 2017 FOMC meeting will be Yellen’s last. She does not want her legacy to be that of the Fed Chair who caused a recession by tightening into weakness. That would repeat the classic Fed blunder of 1937.\\n\\nYellen’s legacy is secure because she was able to begin rate hikes and balance sheet normalization, both of which reversed the easy money policies of Ben Bernanke. She will rest on those laurels and not take a risky rate decision on her way out the door.\\n\\nEventually the markets will figure this out. Right now markets are giving a nearly 90% chance of a rate hike in December based on CME Fed Funds futures. That rate will drop significantly by December 13 when the FOMC meets again with a press conference. (There’s another meeting on November 1, but no one expects any policy changes then).\\n\\nAs market probabilities catch up with reality, the dollar will sink, the euro and gold will rally, and interest rates will resume their long downward slide.',\n",

       " ('Authored by James Rickards via The Daily Reckoning,\\n\\nWill Republicans and Democrats agree on a budget, and avoid a government shutdown after midnight Friday?\\n\\nI’d say the odds are 50/50. Actually, I put the odds of a shutdown at about 55%. There’s certainly enough substance here to be wary.\\n\\nThe government could shut down because of disagreements over defense spending, funding for Trump’s wall with Mexico, deportation of illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children (the “Dreamer Act” also referred to as “DACA”), funding for Planned Parenthood, funding for Obamacare (called “SCHIP”), disaster relief and more.\\n\\nThere’s not much middle ground between Democrats and Republicans on many of these hot button issues.\\n\\nHow would a shutdown affect the Fed’s plans to raise rates on the 13th?\\n\\nIf an agreement can’t be reached and the government does shut down, it’s very difficult to imagine that the Fed would go forward with its planned interest rate hike on Dec 13.\\n\\nMeanwhile, markets are almost certain the Fed will raise rates. It’s already “baked into the cake.”\\n\\nThe euro, yen, gold and Treasury notes are all fully priced for rate hike. If it happens, those instruments won’t change much because the event is priced.\\n\\nBut we could see a violent market reaction if Janet Yellen stays put and doesn’t raise rates.\\n\\nIf the Fed doesn’t raise rates, gold could soar as the Fed passes on its best chance to raise rates and markets perceive that easy money is here to stay. Euros, yen and Treasury notes will also soar.\\n\\nOf course, saying the government could shut down is different than saying the government will shut down. Again, I give it about a 55% chance at this point.\\n\\nAnd there are lots of ways for things to go wrong.\\n\\nLate last week the Commerce Department released the October PCE core inflation data. This is important because that’s the number the Fed watches. There are plenty of other inflation readings out there (CPI, PPI, core, non-core, trimmed mean, etc), but PCE Core year-over-year is the one the Fed uses to benchmark their performance in terms of their inflation goal.\\n\\nThe Fed’s target for PCE Core is 2%. The October reading was 1.4%. For weeks I’d been saying that a 1.3% reading would put the rate hike on hold, and a 1.6% reading would make the rate hike a done deal. So, the actual reading of 1.4% was in the mushy middle of that easy-to-forecast range.\\n\\nWhat’s interesting is that the prior month was also 1.4%, so the new number is unchanged from September. That’s not what the Fed wants to see. They want to see progress toward their 2% goal.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the 1.4% from September was a revised number. It was earlier reported at 1.3% (the same number as August).\\n\\nYou can read this two ways. If you see the August 1.3% as a low, then you can say the 1.4% readings for September and October were progress toward the Fed’s 2% target. It’s a thin reed, but Yellen could use this to justify her view that the year-long weakness in PCE Core is “transitory.”\\n\\nOn the other hand, these 0.1% moves month-to-month are really statistical noise and may even be due to rounding. The bigger picture is that PCE Core is weak and nowhere near the Fed’s target. Another rate hike in December could be a huge blunder if it slows the economy further and leads to more weakness in PCE Core.\\n\\nOn balance, the PCE Core number is probably just enough (barely) to justify a rate hike. I’ve raised my probability of a December rate hike from 30% to just over 50% — 55%. That’s what analysts are supposed to do; they update forecasts continually based on new data. You can’t be stubborn about your analysis.\\n\\nI’m not trying to be “in consensus” or “out-of-consensus.” I just want to get it right, and that means sometimes I’ll be in consensus. Other times, I won’t be.\\n\\nBut you should forget how the market is pricing the outcome. The Fed funds futures market has been off by orders of magnitude before. In mid-February 2017, the futures markets gave the odds of a rate hike in March at 30%.\\n\\nI was giving 80% odds.\\n\\nWithin three trading days at the end of February, the market odds shifted from 30% to 80% before converging at 100% by the March meeting.\\n\\nThat does not mean I’ve got it right this time. But it does illustrate that the futures market does not always get this right — not even close.\\n\\nAnd markets are being set up for a fall.\\n\\nBull markets in stocks seem unstoppable right up until the moment they stop. Then comes a rapid crash-and-burn phase.\\n\\nIs there ever any warning that a collapse is about to happen?\\n\\nOf course there is. Analysts warn about it all the time and provide mountains of data and historical evidence to back up their analysis. The problem is that everyone ignores them.\\n\\nYou can talk about the dangers represented by CAPE ratios, margin levels, computerized trading, persistent low volatility and complacency all you want, but nothing seems to slow down this bull market.\\n\\nYet there is one thing that can stop a bull market in its tracks, and that’s corporate earnings.\\n\\nThe simplest form of stock market valuation is to project earnings, apply a multiple and, voilà, you have a valuation. Multiples are already near record highs, so there’s not much room for expansion there.\\n\\nThe only variable left is projected earnings and that’s where Wall Street analysts are having a field day ramping up stock prices. Earnings did grow significantly in 2017 on a year-over-year basis, but that’s mainly because earnings were weak in 2016, so the year-over-year growth was relatively easy.\\n\\nNow comes the hard part.\\n\\nHow do you expand earnings again in 2018 when 2017 was such a strong year? Wall Street just uses a simple extrapolation and says next year will be like this year, only better! But there is every reason to doubt that extrapolation.\\n\\nEarnings are likely to fall short of expectations, which can lead to a correction. Once that happens, multiples can shrink as well. Soon you’re in a full-scale bear market with stock prices down 20% or more.\\n\\nThat’s without even considering a war with North Korea and all of the dangers others have already mentioned. This may be your last clear chance to lighten up on listed equity exposure before the bubble bursts.\\n\\nMarkets are creatures of manipulation by Fed policy changes, statements, forward guidance and the other prestidigitation of modern central banks. That’s what you get after 10 years of ZIRP, QE, tapering, QT, forward guidance, currency wars and musings about NIRP.\\n\\nShutdown or no shutdown, the Fed has painted itself into a corner and there’s no way to escape the room. That’s the larger story to keep in mind as Dec. 13 approaches.\\n\\nTune out the current sideshow and keep that in mind.',\n",

       " ('Authored by Jeff Thomas via InternationalMan.com,\\n\\nFor many years, I’ve described black markets not as the evil danger to economies that governments profess them to be, but as predictable and sensible reactions to the overregulation of official markets.\\n\\nBlack markets appear whenever an official market has become overregulated or otherwise unworkable due to governmental interference. They then thrive in direct proportion to the failure of official markets to function freely. They are, in fact, both a barometer and a checks-and-balances system for official markets.\\n\\nBack in 2008, I commented on the growth of the black market in Zimbabwe, as that country slid from inflation to hyperinflation. At that time, the people resorted to the use of other currencies (most notably the US dollar) as black market currency. The government, desperate to force their people into the dying Zim dollar, made it illegal to use the US dollar, but this hardly made a dent in the use of what was clearly a more stable currency. The ban on the US dollar only succeeded in driving it underground. Commerce did not grind to a halt, and money did not cease to change hands. The only real change was that the Zimbabwean government was taken out of the monetary loop.\\n\\nThe significance here is that when a government corrupts its official market, a black market arises in equal measure to recreate a “free” market. Its very illegality assures that it remains free of regulations and functions effectively.\\n\\nIn 2008, the Zim dollar crashed through hyperinflation. (At that time, the largest denomination for a bank note was $100 trillion, and even that soon became worthless in terms of purchasing power.)\\n\\nThe government then attempted a series of measures that were, predictably, big on government control but did little to correct the government-created economic problem.\\n\\nBond notes were put forward as a panacea to diminish the flight of wealth from Zimbabwe, yet the cash crisis continued unabated. Those awaiting cash transfers at a bank may wait a month to be cleared and, even then, the transfer may be refused.\\n\\nRecently, The Standard, Zimbabwe’s leading Sunday newspaper, ran an article entitled, “Black market thrives, as banks run dry.”\\n\\nSome highlights from that article:\\n\\nHARARE’S Road Port has become the unofficial bank of last resort, never short of cash, no queues and a multicurrency platform. The money market at this busy bus terminus now plays the role that the formal banking sector has failed. It is effectively making a mockery of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ).\\n\\nThis points to the nature of black markets. They thrive based upon fulfilling an existing need, not upon government control. They therefore replace whatever services the official market fails to provide.\\n\\n“Top government officials, supermarket owners and service stations were behind the thriving black market, which is never short of cash.”\\n\\nAs I’ve commented in the past, the most essential commodities are food and fuel, in that order. Consequently, when an official market begins to fail, these commodities are always the first to generate a black market. In such cases, even the most law-abiding citizens will find a means of exchange to provide food for their families and to buy fuel to keep themselves mobile.\\n\\nAdditionally, this quote unintentionally reveals the way in which a black market eventually succeeds over a dysfunctional official market—the top officials eventually join in its use. This occurs when the leaders realise that it’s easier for them to obtain food and fuel when they surreptitiously resort to the use of the black market. (When the Minister of Agriculture finds that his cook routinely buys food on the black market to place on his table, as his plate would sometimes be empty otherwise, the minister is likely to realise that the jig is up and the only way forward is to acknowledge and legalise the black market.)\\n\\nAt present, ministers have gone so far as to purchase pricey cars and electronic items with black market cash, as even they find their own official market non-navigable.\\n\\n“In Harare’s central business district, especially after 5pm, fuel stations refuse to accept plastic money, forcing motorists to buy in cash, which they in turn allegedly pour on the black market.”\\n\\nThis comment provides insight for those who recognise that a “War on Cash” is afoot in the world today.\\n\\nZimbabwe has done all it could to make it impossible for its people to use anything but the official currency in day-to-day transactions. Instead, the people have turned to the US dollar, the rand, the pula, and even barter to circumvent the oppressive government currency restrictions. The reference here to the refusal of credit cards exemplifies the fact that, as banks increase their stranglehold on deposited funds, the people increasingly turn to cash—any form of cash—rather than relinquish their freedom to engage in commerce as they see fit. (This is not done through courage or patriotism; it’s done through a need for convenience and simplicity.)\\n\\nAnd so, any involvement by banks and government becomes increasingly avoided, even as regards the acceptance of credit cards for payment, as they require the acknowledgement of a credit to account by banks.\\n\\nMany in the Western world—the former “free” world—fear that the War on Cash will result in their accounts in banks being frozen and possibly confiscated. They also fear that their safe deposit boxes will be raided. Finally, they fear that the day will come that they can no longer perform any monetary transaction without a bank being the middleman, as a result of electronic currency that’s only available through the banks.\\n\\nThis fear is quite justified, as this is clearly the direction in which the banks are headed. However, as history attests, human beings continue to be inventive whenever banks or governments put on the monetary squeeze. The more arrogant the banks and political leaders are of their omniscience over the populace, the less likely they are to credit the populace for finding ways to worm out of this one-sided deal.\\n\\nAt first, it’s always those who already live on the wrong side of the law who create black markets. But when we reach that point mentioned above—the point at which food for the family and fuel for mobility are at stake—the average man will join the black market. Soon after that point, it becomes ubiquitous and, in some cases, becomes the primary market, as it has in Zimbabwe.\\n\\nGovernments will always oppress their minions if they can. The greater the pressure, the sooner the minions create a solution.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nZimbabwe’s hyperinflation provides an important lesson about what really happens when a currency collapses. We think a financial crisis is coming to the US. It’s going to be much worse, much longer, and very different than what we saw in 2008 and 2009. That’s exactly why New York Times best-selling author Doug Casey and his team just released a video. It reveals why a financial shock far greater than 2008 could strike America within the next seven months. Click here to watch it.',\n",

       " ('Authored by Jim Carey via GeopoliticsAlert.com,\\n\\nEarlier this week notorious war hawk US Senator John McCain (R-Az) was diagnosed with brain cancer. While the liberal and conservative establishments are sending their regards, Geopolitics Alert instead compiled a list of reasons why we don’t care about McCain.\\n\\nThe list is of course a history of all the instances McCain has called for US-led intervention around the world. There’s obviously a long history here, so Geopolitics Alert has compiled the largest examples from Europe to Asia. We’ll start with the obvious wars first.\\n\\nAfghanistan and Iraq\\n\\nObviously every US senator (besides California’s Barbara Lee) voted to give president George W. Bush the power to invade Afghanistan following the events of September 11th. However, McCain wasn’t happy with just moving to invade Afghanistan. No, he had other targets on his mind as early as the day after the towers fell.\\n\\nDespite McCain’s claim in 2014 that “the Iraq war probably wouldn’t have happened” if he had won the 2000 Republican primary and then general election, this assertion seems ridiculous. On September 12th 2001, McCain appeared on MSNBC presenting a long list of countries he felt were providing a “safe harbor” to groups like al Qaeda. This list of course included Iraq and several other countries that appear later on this list.\\n\\nSyria\\n\\nAnother country on that 2001 list (of course) was Syria. Now, the Bush regime may have never gotten a chance to continue toppling Mideast countries (thanks to the failure in Iraq and the exposure of that war being sold on lies). But McCain seemingly never lost sight of his hatred for Bashar Al-Assad.\\n\\nShortly after the Arab Spring “broke out” in Syria, McCain – and his constant partner in war crimes Sen. Lindsey Graham – quickly found communication channels with the “Syrian opposition.” Just a few short months after the US endorsed protests in Syria (even having their ambassador attend), McCain and Graham began calling for arms to start flowing to the Free Syrian Army and other “rebel” groups.\\n\\nLibya\\n\\nMcCain’s plans for Syria never quite worked the way he wanted but he probably should’ve know they would never yield a positive result. If McCain didn’t want to look at Iraq to prove that point, he had another more recent example he could’ve used: the NATO intervention in Libya.\\n\\nIt was less than a year before McCain wanted to arm Syrian takfiris that he had supported with the bombing and no fly zones in Libya. McCain even wanted tougher actions against the country. Which has now become an anarchic Wild West that’s home to all sorts of horrors from the Islamic State to a new slave trade.\\n\\nWest and Central Africa\\n\\nMcCain is also a champion of the “war on terror” in other parts of Africa. While McCain hasn’t directly supported terrorists in some countries in Africa, he still has called for more US intervention across the continent.\\n\\nThis list includes countries dealing with Islamic insurgencies, such as Mali. McCain has also called for plans like “deploying Special Forces” to rescue girls kidnapped by Boko Haram in Nigeria and intervention in Sudan, where McCain and his wife have invested money for some time.\\n\\nIran\\n\\nAnother country on the list of hated nations originally put forth by Bush undersecretary of defense Paul Wolfowitz, and also another long time target of McCain, is of course Iran.\\n\\nAlthough McCain has always said “he prays” there will never be at war with Iran, the man constantly calls for it and even jokes about bombing the country when he feels the mood is right. The truth of the matter is, McCain’s positions towards Iran are so hostile that even flagship neoconservative institutions like the Cato Institute think he is too hawkish.\\n\\nBosnia and Kosovo\\n\\nBut McCain isn’t satisfied with just backing salafi jihadists in the traditional Middle East and North African theaters. He’s also backed violent radicals across the fringes of Europe. This trend really started in the mid 1990’s when McCain was a vocal supporter of then president Bill Clinton’s war in Bosnia.\\n\\nMany of the Muslims traveling to Bosnia joining the mujahideen there have joined groups like IS in recent years. And IS flags can occasionally be seen in the Sunni areas of Bosnia now. McCain was still backing potential takfiri movements, recently accusing Russia of interfering in local affairs, and calling for more US intervention in the country.\\n\\nMcCain made similar decisions when he advocated US intervention in Kosovo in the late 90’s. In the Kosovo conflict, McCain backed the Kosovo Liberation Army: a genocidal jihadist organization with ties to Al Qaeda under Osama Bin Laden.\\n\\nUkraine\\n\\nDon’t be fooled into thinking that McCain only supports jihadists in Eastern Europe though! He also backs the overt Nazis acting as death squads for Kiev in the ongoing Ukrainian conflict.\\n\\nThis of course started in 2014, but McCain has continued to pledge support for Kiev’s crimes in the Donbass region to this day. This is all par for the course in McCain’s larger theme of challenging Russia– the country he believes controls the separatists in eastern Ukraine.\\n\\nRussia\\n\\nThe story of McCain’s hatred of Russia spans back to the Cold War. We won’t get into McCain’s fear of communism that’s evolved into just general Russophobia. But we will say he didn’t have many excuses to focus on making threats towards Moscow for a good 15-20 year stretch.\\n\\nThis changed in 2008, with the war in South Ossetia between Georgia and Russia. During this conflict McCain was the loudest voice saying the US “should immediately call a meeting of the North Atlantic Council to assess Georgia’s security and review measures NATO can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation.”\\n\\nThis same situation repeated in Ukraine in 2014 but McCain’s worst comments came this year. As soon as the US Intelligence Community’s accused Russia of interference in the 2016 US elections– and without any evidence– McCain was first to say the event was an “act of war.”\\n\\nNorth Korea\\n\\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DRPK/North Korea) was also an early target of McCain’s making his September 12th wish list. More recently though, the restyled “Trump opponent” McCain was all-in on the new regime’s saber rattling. Calling on Trump to strike the nuclear armed country.\\n\\nBonus: China\\n\\nChina is kind of in its own class with McCain, who’s made strange vague threats towards the country in the past. Such as “the Arab spring is coming to China,” whatever that means. China may be a target on the periphery for McCain but he does still encourage antagonizing the country to this day. Calling for things like more “freedom of navigation drills” and other naval exercises in the South China Sea.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nSo, in summation, next time someone asks why you don’t care about John McCain’s clock running out, show them this article. McCain has encouraged the spread of death worldwide. The day he leaves congress will be a victory for the human race.',\n",

Rather, they’re over opposing answers to the question of how a goal can be achieved with the least sacrifice. For lawmakers, the goal is to promise the populace something for nothing while pretending to make good on it.\\n\\nTake the latest tax bill, for instance. The GOP wants to tax less and spend more. The Democrat party wants to tax more and spend even more. We don’t recall seeing any proposals to tax less, spend less, and shrink the size of the state. And why would we?\\n\\nToday’s central planners and social engineers are enlightened and progressive. They know much more about anything and everything than the rest of us. In particular, they share a general sense that they know how to spend your money better than you.\\n\\nAt best, the central planners call your money to Washington so they can then distribute it back to your friends and neighbors. In reality, the lawmakers call your money to Washington where they distribute it to their friends and neighbors – not yours. This is not a matter of opinion. It’s a matter of fact.\\n\\nIs it a coincidence that the top three wealthiest counties in the country are in the shadow of the Capitol in the D.C. suburbs? What it is exactly that the residents of these counties do that’s of tangible value is unclear. However, what is clear is that bogus government jobs in Loudoun County and Fairfax County, Virginia, pay big bucks. But that’s not all…\\n\\nGarbage In Garbage Out\\n\\nFurther up the eastern seaboard, Wall Street has a good thing going too. The big bankers and brokers make big bucks extracting capital from Main Street America. That’s a fair characterization, right?\\n\\nPerhaps the big bankers and brokers really are efficiently allocating capital to its highest and best use. Who knows? But as far as we can tell, they’re gambling with other people’s money – and collecting fees regardless of how their coin tosses fall. It’s always, ‘heads I win, tails you lose.’ Not a bad fugazi gig, if you can get it.\\n\\nOf course, the cornerstone of it all is the Federal Reserve. Through what they call “open market operations,” the Fed rigs the game in Washington’s and Wall Street’s favor. Indeed, the process is really quite elegant.\\n\\nUnder the smokescreen cover of garbage in economic data, the Fed’s economists produce garbage out bar charts and line graphs. These, in short, are fabricated depictions of the economy’s growth, consumer and producer prices, personal consumption expenditures, unemployment rate, and whatever other aggregate metrics are deemed to be of vital importance. What’s more, these fabricated depictions serve as the basis for the Fed’s monetary policy decisions.\\n\\nDo the graphs show price inflation heating up or cooling down? What about GDP or the unemployment rate? Is one going up while the other’s going down? Is one going down while the other’s going up?\\n\\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) deliberates over these questions about every six weeks. Then the Fed goes to work inflating the nation’s money supply, with the occasional rug yank, for the stated purpose of getting the charts and graphs to illustrate the garbage data to their liking. What to make of it?\\n\\nThe Rug Yank Phase of Fed Policy\\n\\nFrom the outside, the Fed’s economists and planners appear to be esteemed professionals, making decisions with the intent of providing for the greater good of the country. They even attend economic conferences and forums where they present their latest research findings on abstract topics like liquidity traps. Some of their studies even include footnotes, as if the professional economists are building upon a concrete knowledge base of human intellect.\\n\\nYet beneath this cover of bogus science, the real sausage is made. Capital is borrowed into existence where it is directed to Washington and Wall Street. There, having first dibs on this phony money, Washington and Wall Street get to spend it as if it has real value.\\n\\nHowever, the real value does not coming from the Fed’s phony money. In fact, as this new phony money appears on the scene, it extracts incremental wealth from the workers and producers across the country that – through their time, talent, and labor – created the wealth to begin with.\\n\\nAt the moment, we’re in the rug yank phase of the Fed’s monetary policy. This is where they reel back credit ever so slightly after letting it run wild over the last decade. This tightening of credit markets has the effect of pulling the rug out from under financial markets and the economy.\\n\\nMonetary policy, without question, is not an exact science. It’s rudimentary guess work that’s based on committee interpretations of bogus data. This week, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate by 0.25 percent to between 1.25 and 1.5 percent. This marks the third increase this year and the fifth increase this cycle.\\n\\nIncidentally, Janet Yellen also delivered her last press conference as Chair of the Federal Reserve, though she’ll likely still Chair the FOMC meeting scheduled for late January. Then Jay “Count Dracula” Powell will take over the helm of the nation’s central bank. The broad expectation is for Powell to continue the rate increase playbook that Yellen has laid out, which includes three quarter percent hikes in 2018.\\n\\nWe wish Powell the best in his endeavors. But we suspect he’ll unwittingly pull the rug out from under financial markets and the economy before he completes his first year. After that, the fun really begins.',\n",

It could also come as a wake-up call for Labour (a communist party), which is advocating borrowing an extra £250 billion.\\n\\nIn a speech at University College London, Sharp warned that Jeremy Corbyn’s public spending policies would be foolish and dire for the economy. Like any rational person understands, communist policies only work for those elites in the government.\\n\\n“A highly indebted government has less capacity to react to crises: we cannot assume that further shocks do not materialize, and evidence demonstrates that fiscal space is a vital national resource to have available to counteract such a shock,” Sharp said. “Reducing fiscal space, therefore, means financial stability is harder to achieve.”\\n\\nMorgan Stanley, in its look-ahead to 2018, warned the UK’s “domestic political situation is at least as significant as Brexit” given the “perceived risks of an incoming Labour administration that could potentially embark on a radical change of policy direction”.\\n\\nA collapsed UK economy would have worldwide ramifications. The real losers in this political game of spending more and tyrannical governments are the everyday men and women who live and work in the UK.\\n\\nShould the Labour party succeed in their borrowing of even more money, the standards of living for the average person would go through the floor – just like Venezuela.\",\n",

McCain on Monday, when the destroyer collided with a merchant ship off the coast of Singapore, leaving 10 sailors missing and five injured. The US Navy is still struggling to find all of the remains of the missing sailors, and has ordered an operational pause for all naval fleets around the world as investigators try to figure out exactly why this terrible accident occurred.\\n\\nAmong the possible causes that are being looked into, one has a raised a few eyebrows. Over the summer there have been two accidental collisions involving the 7th fleet, and a total of 4 similar incidents this year. This has led some Navy officials to suspect that a cyber attack may have been responsible for the crash, as well as other recent Naval accidents.\\n\\nThe Navy has not ruled out an intentional action behind the latest deadly collision between a Navy destroyer and a merchant ship, the chief of naval operations told reporters Monday. “That’s is certainly something we are giving full consideration to but we have no indication that that’s the case—yet,” Adm. John Richardson, the CNO, said at the Pentagon. “But we’re looking at every possibility, so we’re not leaving anything to chance,” he said. Asked if that includes the possibility the electronic defenses on the guided missile destroyer USS John S. McCain were hacked in a cyber attack, Richardson said investigators will look into all possible causes. “We’ll take a look at all of that, as we did with the Fitzgerald,” the four-star admiral said, referring to another Navy warship collision with a merchant ship in June near Japan.\\n\\nSo far the Navy has made it clear that there currently isn’t any evidence that the neither USS McCain, nor any other naval vessel, has suffered from a cyber attack. However, there are quite a few top notch cyber security experts who think that all of these collisions probably have something in common.\\n\\n“There’s something more than just human error going on because there would have been a lot of humans to be checks and balances,” Jeff Stutzman, an ex-information warfare specialist in the Navy, who now works at a cyber threat intelligence company, told McClatchyDC. “When you are going through the Strait of Malacca, you can’t tell me that a Navy destroyer doesn’t have a full navigation team going with full lookouts on every wing and extra people on radar,” he said. Itay Glick, the founder of cyber security firm Votiro, told news.com.au that the possibility of cyber interference was the first thing that came to his mind when he heard about the incident. “I don’t believe in coincidence,” Glick told the website. “Both USS McCain and USS Fitzgerald were part of the 7th Fleet, there is a relationship between these two events and there may be a connection,” he added.\\n\\nThe only other question that remains is, if these collisions were caused by cyber attacks, who is responsible? One likely culprit seems to be China. For years the Chinese government has complained about the US Navy’s presence in the South China Sea, which they claim as their territorial waters. In fact, following the USS McCain’s accident, the Global Times, which is effectively a mouthpiece of the government, claimed that Chinese citizens were celebrating the collision.\\n\\nIt’s also important to consider the fact that many US Naval vessels are riddled with counterfeit parts from China. A Senate led investigation in 2012 found that our ships contained over a million counterfeit parts, mostly of Chinese origin. Obviously, this raises the possibility that the Chinese government may have used black markets to secretly funnel parts to the US Navy, which contain backdoors that are easily exploitable.\\n\\nBut perhaps what’s most telling, is how a state-run Chinese media outlet responded to the USS McCain collision, by suggesting that the US Navy has become a dangerous presence for commercial shipping in the South China Sea.\\n\\nBEIJING (Reuters) – The U.S. navy’s latest collision at sea, the fourth in its Pacific fleet this year, shows it is becoming an increasing risk to shipping in Asia despite its claims of helping to protect freedom of navigation, an official Chinese newspaper said… …The state-run China Daily said in an editorial on Tuesday that people will wonder why such a sophisticated navy keeps having these problems. “The investigations into the latest collision will take time to reach their conclusions, but there is no denying the fact that the increased activities by U.S. warships in Asia-Pacific since Washington initiated its rebalancing to the region are making them a growing risk to commercial shipping,” it said.\\n\\nThere’s no proof that China has been hacking our ships, but the possibility can’t be ruled out.',\n",

       " ('Authored by Michael Snyder via The American Dream blog,\\n\\nHurricane Irma is more powerful than all of the other major Atlantic storms this year combined, and it has an eye as large as the entire Detroit metro area. It is being reported that “upwards of 90%” of Barbuda has already been destroyed by the storm, and it is being projected that some areas of Puerto Rico could be without power “for between four and six months”. You may want to view these photos and these videos to get a better idea of the immense destructiveness of this very powerful storm. The latest forecasts have Hurricane Irma making landfall in Florida, but so far the two nuclear power plants in Florida that would be directly in the path of the storm have not even started the process of shutting down…\\n\\nIn anticipation of powerful Hurricane Irma, which projections on Wednesday showed headed straight for South Florida, Florida Power & Light’s two nuclear plants were finalizing staffing plans and cleaning up the grounds. But neither Turkey Point nor the St. Lucie plant further up the coast had made the call yet to shutting down the plants.\\n\\nPeter Robbins, spokesman for FPL, said shutting down a reactor is a gradual process, and the decision will be made “well in advance” of the storm making landfall.\\n\\nRobbins said the plant’s reactors are encased in six feet of steel-reinforced concrete and sit 20 feet above sea level. Turkey Point has backup generators, extra fuel and, as a “backup to the backup,” replacement parts and materials can be flown in from Tennessee. The St. Lucie Nuclear Power Plant is equally protected, Robbins said, and can withstand severe flooding from storm surges. St. Lucie’s nuclear plant survived Hurricanes Frances and Jeanne in 2005 and Wilma the year after. When the eye of Andrew passed over Turkey Point, some facilities around the reactor buildings took a beating. Ultimately, the state’s oldest nuclear plant suffered $90 million in damages, including to systems that were supposed to be hurricane-proof. One of the 400-foot smokestacks for the old oil-burning power plant was cracked in half, even though it was rated to survive 235-mph winds. Andrew blew down all but six of the 41 warning sirens within 10 miles of the plant. The storm left the plant running on backup generators for more than a week to cool the shut-down reactor. A main access road was blocked by debris. “It handled Andrew as it was designed to,” Robbins said. “It’s one of the safest and most robust structures in the state, of not the country.”\\n\\nZH: One word comes to mind hearing all this - \"contained.\"\\n\\nWe all remember what happened with Fukushima, and we definitely do not want to see a repeat on U.S. soil. The Fukushima nuclear disaster changed millions of minds about the safety of nuclear power, and as a member of Congress I will do all that I can to encourage the development of our solar power, wind power and geothermal power capabilities.\\n\\nLet us hope that Hurricane Irma weakens before it gets to Florida, because the destruction that it is causing right now is off the charts. When it made landfall in Barbuda, there were some wind gusts that were “above 215 mph”…\\n\\nIrma first made landfall in Barbuda — an island with a population of about 1,600 — around 1:47 a.m. ET Wednesday. Local weather stations there captured wind gusts of 155 mph before going silent, indicating the instruments had been blown away. Irma’s sustained winds have been reported at 185 mph, with gusts above 215 mph.\\n\\nWhen you have winds that high, there is little that you can do to prepare. According to one top official, “upwards of 90%” of Barbuda has already been destroyed…\\n\\nAt least one death was reported in Barbuda, according to ABS TV Antigua. Charles Fernandez, minister of foreign affairs and international trade for Antigua and Barbuda, told ABS that destruction on Barbuda was “upwards of 90%.” Irma destroyed government buildings, tore roofs from houses and left northern Caribbean islands without power or communications.\\n\\nConsidering what has already happened in the Caribbean, it astounds me that Miami is not being evacuated yet. If all of these communities in the south Florida area try to wait until the last minute to evacuate, it is going to create a traffic nightmare of epic proportions. According to CNN, we could be looking at “one of the largest mass evacuations in US history”…\\n\\nBased on Irma’s projected path, which includes Florida’s heavily populated eastern coast, the enormous storm could create one of the largest mass evacuations in US history, CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen said. Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties combined have about 6 million people. Monroe County, home to the Florida Keys, has already ordered mandatory evacuations. Broward County, which includes Fort Lauderdale, issued a mandatory evacuation Wednesday for areas east of Federal Highway.\\n\\nThere is still a chance that the storm may not hit Florida at all, and let us hope that is the case.\\n\\nSadly, there are some out there that actually want the storm to hit Florida. In fact, some leftists on Twitter are actually rooting for the storm to destroy President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.\\n\\nHow can people be so cruel? When I first made the decision to jump into the world of politics, I thought that I would be able to avoid much of the nastiness, but I quickly found out that people are going to call me all sorts of names too. I am starting to understand why it is so hard to get good people to run for office, because there is a great price to be paid for putting yourself out there.\\n\\nIn this situation, my hope is that people down in south Florida won’t wait for a formal evacuation order and will start getting out well ahead of this storm. According to CNBC, Hurricane Irma could cause a quarter of a trillion dollars in damage if it is still a category 5 storm once it reaches Miami…\\n\\nBut if it stays a Category 5 and hits Miami, the $125 billion estimate could be doubled, making it by far the costliest storm ever. At $105.8 billion, Hurricane Katrina in 2005 is currently the leader, though Hurricane Harvey, which struck Houston two weeks ago, could well surpass that total.\\n\\nCan you imagine what a quarter of a trillion dollars of damage would look like?\\n\\nAnd let us not forget that another hurricane is following right behind Irma. This could easily become the worst hurricane season in all of U.S. history, and we still have many more weeks to go before the season is over.\\n\\nMeanwhile, a disaster of another sort is unfolding out west. Large portions of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana are literally on fire. One of the reasons why we are having such a huge problem with wildfires out west is because the federal government is not properly managing public lands. So when these fires hit areas controlled by the feds, they tend to burn more intensely than they should. I intend to fight to have control of those lands transferred to state governments, and I hope that you will support my efforts. Here in Idaho, it has been estimated that we have more than a trillion dollars worth of natural resources under our feet, and if we can get full control of our public lands it would end our state budget problems permanently.\\n\\nOur world is increasingly becoming a very unstable place, and we are certainly seeing evidence of that this month.\\n\\nLet us hope that things start settling down, but unfortunately I don’t think that is going to happen any time soon…',\n",

       " ('Authored by Michael Snyder via The Economic Collapse blog,\\n\\nWhenever you let federal bureaucrats get their hands on anything they are probably going to ruin it. During the Obama administration, the Department of Education spearheaded a transformation of American education that was absolutely breathtaking. Over a period of about five years, Common Core standards were implemented in almost every state in the entire nation. Unfortunately, this has resulted in a huge step backward for public education in this country. Common Core has been called “state-sponsored child abuse”, and it is a big reason why U.S. students are scoring so poorly on standardized tests compared to much of the rest of the world.\\n\\nAccording to Wikipedia, at one point 46 states had adopted Common Core, but now some states are having second thoughts…\\n\\n46 states initially adopted the Common Core State Standards, although implementation has not been uniform. At least 12 states have introduced legislation to repeal the standards outright,[1] and Indiana has since withdrawn from the standards.\\n\\nSadly, many parents don’t even understand how dramatically our system of education has been tampered with. In her book entitled The Education Invasion: How Common Core Fights Parents for Control of American Kids, Joy Pullmann exposes how the Gates Foundation has been one of the key players in the effort to get Common Core introduced into classrooms all over America…\\n\\nOrganized in seven chapters, her book describes how the Gates Foundation promoted and continues to promote one extremely wealthy couple’s uninformed, unsupported, and unsupportable ideas on education for other people’s children while their own children are enrolled in a non-Common Cored private school. It explains how (but not exactly why) the Gates Foundation helped to centralize control of public education in the U.S. Department of Education. It also explains why parents, teachers, local school boards, and state legislators were the last to learn how the public schools their local and state taxes supported had been nationalized without Congressional knowledge or permission; and why they were expected to believe that their local public schools were now accountable for what and how they teach … not to the local and state taxpayers who fund them or to locally-elected school boards that by law are still supposed to set education policies not already determined by their state legislature … but to a distant bureaucracy in exchange for money to their state department of education to close “achievement gaps” between unspecified groups.\\n\\nBut this isn’t just an issue about control. The truth is that the approach to teaching basic fundamentals such as how to add and how to subtract is fundamentally different under Common Core.\\n\\nLet me share just three examples that show how much Common Core is changing the way that U.S. students learn math. All of these examples have been floating around Facebook, and if you have never seen these before they are likely to make you quite angry.\\n\\nIf I asked you to subtract 12 from 32, how would you do it? Well, the “new way” is much, much more complicated than how we were all taught to do it…\\n\\nIf that first one seemed bizarre to you, than you really aren’t going to like this one…\\n\\nAnd this last one was so confusing that a parent with a degree in engineering decided to include his own commentary on his child’s homework…\\n\\nHow are kids supposed to function in the real world if this is how they are learning to do basic math?\\n\\nPersonally, I am going to teach my daughter that 9 + 6 equals 15. But that isn’t how it is supposed to be done under Common Core. You can watch a video of a teacher explaining the very convoluted Common Core way to solve that math equation right here.\\n\\nAnd of course it isn’t just math that is the problem. Common Core is systematically “dumbing down” our young people, and that may help to explain why the average U.S. college freshman now reads at a seventh grade level.\\n\\nSo what is the answer?\\n\\nThe first step in fixing our education system is to repeal Common Core. But even in red states such as Idaho there is a lot of resistance…\\n\\nSince their inception, the Idaho Core Standards have been enmeshed in controversy. Some legislators and citizens have pushed for a repeal of the Idaho Core Standards, the state’s version of Common Core standards in math and English language arts. Those repeal efforts have gone nowhere in the Legislature.\\n\\nI don’t know what is wrong with our legislators. The Republicans have full control in this state, and so there is absolutely no excuse for not getting something done.\\n\\nAs I end this article, I want to give you an idea of just how far the quality of education in America has fallen over the past 100 years. In Kentucky, an eighth grade exam from 1912 made a lot of headlines when it was donated to the Bullitt County History Museum. As you can see, it is doubtful whether many of our college students would be able to pass such an exam today…',\n",

       " ('Authored by Mike Krieger via Liberty Blitzkrieg blog,\\n\\nA lot of people remain in denial about the current political environment. Whether it’s a neocon Never Trumper, or a manic Hillary dead-ender, what these people all have in common is they firmly and passionately think their world is somehow coming back. They still don’t understand that the party’s over.\\n\\nIn our foolish apathy, we entrusted the country to these “very smart people” and they handed the entire thing over to crooked oligarchs, while simultaneously cheerleading us into a never-ending stream of reckless, inhumane imperial wars. They hollowed out and feasted on the entire nation and now, incredibly enough, have rebranded themselves as leaders of a toothless resistance to the mess they created. Delusional doesn’t even begin to describe these people. They genuinely think Trump’s rise represents some bizarre historical blip, and once the hideous blemish is removed, things can carry on as they were. That’s not going to happen.\\n\\nBefore I get into the thick of it, I want to revisit something I wrote a couple of weeks ago in the post, The Center Cannot Hold – Decentralize or Die:\\n\\nIn order to understand the long-term implications of these emails on the future of the nation, you need a good understanding of the primary warring factions in American politics today. We have Donald Trump supporters/voters, Hillary Clinton supporters/voters, and a resurgent left inspired and energized by the principles and ideals espoused by Bernie Sanders. The first two have absolutely zero overlap and pretty much hate each other, while the third group can sometimes identify with either camp depending on the issue, but pretty much think they’re both crazy and dangerous. The key point I’m trying to make is that there is no “center” in American politics anymore, and any discussion of this is pure fantasy. Moreover, any remaining center that still exists, is unlikely to exist at all in a year or so as more and more people feel forced to choose sides. When you create an environment as charged as this one where everyone is accusing their political opponents of treason, this is what you get; and it’s only going to get worse. A lot worse… If what I wrote above rings true to you on any level, it has dire implications for the future of these United States. The first two groups, Trump supporters and Hillary supporters have absolutely nothing in common and that’s not going to change. In fact, it’s probably going to get much, much worse. Trump supporters think the Democrats and the media have been gunning for a way to remove him from office since the day he was elected, while Hillary supporters think he’s a treasonous puppet of Vladimir Putin. How can these two warring factions come to any sort of agreement on anything? The answer is, they can’t and they won’t. Meanwhile, Bernie supporters are likely to largely stay on the sidelines hoping these two sides destroy each other in their madness.\\n\\nIn a gross oversimplification, the above implies that the political environment going forward will be defined by a vicious battle between the Trump faction and the Hillary faction. While I think this will probably be true for much of the rest of 2017, there’s a good chance that a year from now, the union of Hillary donors, Never Trump neocons and the corporate media will find themselves increasingly irrelevant, on their way to being wiped off the political landscape forever. In its place, a more genuine opposition political movement will take form and face off against Trump on real issues.\\n\\nThis movement was first really seen on the national level with the candidacy of Bernie Sanders, but it takes on many different forms. The one aspect I want to discuss today due to its growing influence and potential for explosive growth, is a faction that has become known as the “Dirtbag Left.”\\n\\nTo get a sense of what I’m talking about, you should read an article published earlier this month at Maclean’s titled, The Rise of the Internet’s ‘Dirtbag Left.’ Here are a few excerpts:\\n\\nNagle sees the rise of the violent, hateful, and often deliberately confounding culture of the alt-right tied up inextricably with failures of the left. Where the internet was once viewed as a utopian space for free expression, and experimentation with thought and identity, it eventually became colonized by a calcified leftist sameness, thanks to sites like Tumblr and Twitter, where buzzwords and ideologies multiply and spread like viruses. There was also a certain sanctimonious and self-righteous tone that came to dominate these conversations. Certain strains of leftism—and especially those that valued identity above all other social and political categories—began to monopolize the free market of ideas, making the experience of being online if not entirely oppressive in its patrolling of ideas and verbiage, then certainly much less fun. Many who were alienated by this culture drove deeper underground, to sites like 4chan and Reddit, where new mutations of far-right, anti-feminist, racist, Islamophobic, white supremacist ideologies—with their focus on memes, jokes, trolling and pushing back against political correctness—restored, for them, the earlier anarchic promise of the Internet. As Nagle writes, the emerging alt-right “had little in the way of a coherent commitment to conservative thought or politics, but shared an anti-PC impulse and a common aesthetic sensibility.” The culture of call-outs and one-upping “wokeness”—a condescending term used to describe an overstated performance of political correctness—was diagnosed as far back as 2013 by British blogger and political theorist Mark Fisher. In his essay “Exiting the Vampire’s Castle,” Fisher decried the “stench of bad conscience and witch-hunting moralism” that emanated from the online social-justice set. He also identified the collective paralysis among those on the left who disagreed with those tactics, a “fear that they will be the next one to be outed, exposed, condemned.” Fisher, predictably, became a target of such condemnation after his essay was published; many ghouls returned to mock him when he committed suicide earlier this year. “Anyone on the left with any independence of mind has experienced this backlash,” says Nagle. “People will look back at this period as a moment of madness—if it ends. I feel like there’s much more of an exciting, funnier left-wing culture emerging around people who are critics of it. That’s not a coincidence. You can’t be a puritanical purger and have a sense of humor. Enter a new culture of the online left. It’s a reinvigorated wing that’s simultaneously anti-alt-right, anti-PC and anti-SJW, anti-centrist and against liberal-democratic line-toeing. It’s a movement that uses many of the tactics of the online alt-right—humour, memes, Twitter trolling and open animosity—while remaining committed to progressive leftist ideology. It’s sometimes called the “alt-left” or the “vulgar left,” or the “Dirtbag Left”—a term coined by Brooklyn based writer, podcaster, and activist Amber A’Lee Frost. Frost is a co-host of the popular politics podcast Chapo Trap House. Founded by politically savvy Twitter jokers Will Menaker, Felix Biederman and Matt Christman, Chapo Trap House gained massive traction during the 2016 U.S. presidential primaries among online factions of “Weird Twitter” and “Left Twitter” who were eager to push back against the ascendency of war-hawk Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and stem the tides of #ImWithHer memes. “Twitter was poised to examine the primaries in a way that the established media either would not or could not,” Frost writes in an e-mail. “This was a great moment in terms of consciousness-raising and communication.”\\n\\nFrom my seat, there are three really important aspects of the “Dirtbag Left” that makes it a very potent political phenomenon.\\n\\nFirst, it doesn’t hold back or pay tribute to the PC speech-policing cultists. People across the political spectrum are sick and tired of people pushing this idea that “language is violence” in order to censor not just political speech, but also comedy. In fact, what attracted many people to the “alt-right” or “alt-light” was simple rebellion against the increased stupidity of political correctness even if they didn’t have much in common with the political positions of Trump. The dirtbag left is quickly taking that advantage away. The second is humor. When was the last time Alex Jones made you genuinely laugh with clever wit as he delivered a political point? Political ideas are powerful, but political ideas coupled with humor are virtually unstoppable. Third, this faction of leftism is waging war against Clinton neoliberal frauds and Trump’s fake populism at the exact same time. Not an easy thing to do, but I think there’s a huge and growing unsatisfied demand for such a perspective.\\n\\nA lot of you will discount the appeal of this movement because many of its most high-profile members are unabashed socialists. This is a big mistake. Remember, Donald Trump won the Presidency not because he was especially great or loved, but because his opponent was terrible, he talked in populist terms, and people just wanted to give a middle finger to the political establishment and corporate media. If that’s right, what’s to stop a movement from winning power if it promises to flip the bird to both Trump and Clinton while also making you laugh? Not much.\\n\\nI think the “DirtBag Left” will catch the Trump team completely off guard over the next few years. The reason Trump’s prospects look pretty good right now for a second term is because there’s no real organized opposition to him. By real organized opposition, I mean a movement driven by actual ideas and passion that is also working on a plan to run a competitive candidate in 2020. The current “resistance” consists of Hillary donors, neocons, the corporate media and elements of the deep state. While Trump complains about this opposition constantly, he doesn’t realize how good he has it. The American public hates those factions more than they hate Trump, and nobody wants to vote for that discredited garbage in 2020.\\n\\nThe best possible thing for Trump in 2020 would be another opponent with no ideas who focuses on stupid slogans ad identity politics. He’d love to once against face off against an empty suit (pantsuit?) who enthusiastically serves as a poodle for billionaire financiers and an assortment of other oligarchs. Trump can be a fake populist his entire first term and still win that race. What presents him a much bigger challenge would be a genuine populist challenger backed by a dynamic, grassroots movement. This is where the “DirtBag Left” comes into play.\\n\\nThis faction isn’t trying to compromise with hopeless #ImStillWithHer clowns. Like myself, 40% of the country is independent and this demographic remains up for grabs in a national election. This is the target audience. People who see that the country continues to circle the toilet bowl, and understand that Trump is a total phony. The best thing Trump has going for him is the media is seen as his primary adversary. As long as he can continue to frame the debate as him vs. the corporate media, he wins. Confronting a competing populist message that wants to deal with oligarchy will be much harder for him, and would in fact push him toward actual populist polices if he wants to win reelection. Just like being against Trump was’t enough for Hillary, being against the media won’t be enough for Trump either, IF a competing message that resonates emerges.\\n\\nIn order to understand the next political wave that will sweep across America, you need to understand the dirtbag left; and if you want to understand the dirtbag left, you need to get to know Chapo Trap House. Below is a clip discussing Hillary’s loss shortly after the election.',\n",

Here’s an excerpt:\\n\\nSaudi Arabia is at risk of becoming a major destabilizing influence in the Arab world, German intelligence has warned. Internal power struggles and the desire to emerge as the leading Arab power threaten to make the key Western ally a source of instability, according to the BND intelligence service. “The current cautious diplomatic stance of senior members of the Saudi royal family will be replaced by an impulsive intervention policy,” a BND memo widely distributed to the German press reads. Saudi Arabia has previously been accused of supplying arms and funding to jihadist groups fighting in Syria, including Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isil).\\n\\nAt the core of this intelligence warning was none other than crown prince Mohamed bin Salman, or MBS.\\n\\nI’ve been warning about the specific dangers presented by his brazen and sociopathic personality for years, and the recent purge finally threw it all into the spotlight for everyone to see.\\n\\nMBS has already wreaked havoc on portions of the region with his reckless and failed polices with respect to both Yemen and Qatar. Today’s post will focus on the humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Yemen, courtesy of the Saudi crown prince.\\n\\nThe New York Times reported last week:\\n\\nSaudi Arabia’s three-day-old blockade of entry points to Yemen threatens to plunge that war-ravaged country into a famine that could starve millions of people, the top relief official of the United Nations said Wednesday. The Yemen crisis has worsened since the Saudis imposed the blockade on Monday after a missile was fired deep into their territory by the Iran-backed Houthi rebel group, which has been warring with a Saudi-led military coalition for nearly three years. Despite Saudi Arabia’s assurances that the measure was temporary while it reviews inspection procedures, virtually all humanitarian deliveries to Yemen have been halted, including at least three United Nations airplanes full of emergency supplies. Mr. Lowcock said the Saudis must immediately allow the entry of food and medicine at all seaports, permit the immediate resumption of air services to the cities of Sana and Aden, and provide an “assurance of no further disruption to these services.” Without such steps, he said, Yemen will suffer “the largest famine the world has seen for many decades, with millions of victims.” The World Food Program, the anti-hunger agency of the United Nations, which has been feeding seven million people a month in Yemen, is now unable to do so, Mr. Lowcock said. “What we need is a winding down of the blockade to save the lives of those people.” The country is struggling with an acute hunger crisis that has affected at least 17 million people, more than a third of them considered close to famine. Yemen also suffering a cholera scourge that has sickened nearly one million. “Humanitarian supply lines to Yemen must remain open,” said Robert Mardini, the Red Cross’s regional director for the Near and Middle East. “Food, medicine and other essential supplies are critical for the survival of 27 million Yemenis already weakened by a conflict now in its third year.”\\n\\nSince then, the Saudis have opened the port of Aden and a crossing at Wadea, but this is woefully inadequate.\\n\\nAs Al Jazeera notes:\\n\\nOn Friday, the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian aid, OCHA, said the coalition was still blocking desperately needed UN aid deliveries to Yemen, despite the reopening of Aden and Wadea. “Humanitarian movements into Yemen remain blocked,” said OCHA spokesman Russell Geekie. “The reopening of the port in Aden is not enough. We need to see the blockade of all the ports lifted, especially Hodeida, for both humanitarian and for commercial imports.” UN aid chief Mark Lowcock told the Security Council this week that unless the blockade is lifted, Yemen will face “the largest famine the world has seen for many decades, with millions of victims”. Stylianides echoed Lowcock’s concerns. Yemen “is suffering the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with more than two-thirds of its population in need of humanitarian assistance”, he said in a statement. “The EU shares the concerns expressed by… Lowcock and calls for full and unrestrained access to be restored immediately, to avoid Yemen suffering the largest famine in decades,” Stylianides said.\\n\\nWhat we’re looking at here is potentially the worst famine in decades, and it’s important for decent U.S. citizens from across the political spectrum to admit our government’s hands are soaked in blood.\\n\\nAs The Intercept reported:\\n\\nSaudi Arabia relies heavily on the U.S. military for intelligence sharing, refueling flights for coalition warplanes, and the transfer of American-made cluster bombs, rockets, and other munitions used against targets in Yemen. Congress, however, has never authorized U.S. support for the war, which has caused 10,000 civilian deaths and has spiraled in recent months into one of the worst humanitarian crises of the century. For two years, Saudi Arabia and its allies have imposed a sea and air blockade around Yemen. Now, more than 7 million Yemenis face starvation and thousands, mostly children, are dying from cholera. Coalition warplanes have repeatedly struck crowded markets, hospitals, power plants, and other civilian targets. Several members of Congress indicated an interest in the issue, noting that the Obama and Trump administrations’ reliance on the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force to justify U.S. involvement in the conflict is absurd. That authorization, after all, was designed to fight the terrorist groups responsible for the September 11 attacks, not to intervene in Yemen’s civil war. For 16 years, the executive branch has pointed to the AUMF as legal justification for its involvement in conflicts across the Middle East and Africa, a strategy that is legally questionable. But the use of the AUMF in the Yemeni context is especially bizarre given that the AUMF’s target is Al Qaeda, and the group AQAP — Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula –is fighting alongside the U.S.-Saudi coalition against the Houthi rebels. One bipartisan legislative attempt to force a vote on authorization for the war, H.Con.Res.81, faced a major setback last week after appearing to gain political momentum. On November 1, lawmakers stripped the bill of its privileged status, meaning the bill no longer maintains a fast-track to a floor vote. The legislation was designed to invoke the War Powers Act of 1973 to terminate U.S. involvement in the Yemen War. Because the bill is no longer privileged, it will head back to the the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which is led by Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., a lawmaker who has expressed deep support for the Saudi-led military campaign. Few expect the legislation to move forward now that it is back in Royce’s domain. In April, the representative read a statement of support for the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen and entered into the congressional record an opinion column written by a Saudi general. The move to crush H.Con.Res.81 was apparently negotiated by Democratic and Republican leadership. As part of a compromise, there will be some congressional debate over the war, though no on-the-record vote for authorization. As The Intercept previously reported, Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., the Democratic whip, was among the Democratic leaders opposed to invoking the War Powers Act to bring U.S. involvement in the war to an end. Still, sponsors of the legislation are hoping to force a debate and an on-the-record vote over the war. “Our national security interests in Yemen are unclear, yet we are giving money and military assistance to Saudi Arabia so they can continue to wage war in Yemen,” said Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., one of 43 co-sponsors. “This military action was never authorized by Congress and the American people deserve an open debate by their elected officials.” Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., also a co-sponsor of the resolution, expressed frustration that House Speaker Paul Ryan has refused to allow a vote on the war and disappointment that the compromise solution negotiated by congressional leadership will not include a binding vote. “This is part of my frustration about the fact Congress does not meet its constitutional responsibility when sending young men and women to die for this country, and we have a constitutional duty that we must debate war,” Jones said. “The vote to go to war in Yemen, we can’t even get a vote on this resolution. To me this is the way Congress does not work. We don’t work because we do not uphold the constitution.”\\n\\nMeanwhile, many of the cretins in Congress can’t be bothered to answer questions about Yemen.\\n\\nUnconstitutional war that could create the worst famine in decades? Meh, I’m too busy trying to figure out how to provide tax breaks to oligarchs.\\n\\nAfter all, who cares, there’s just too much money to be made from war.\\n\\nFrom The Washington Post:\\n\\nBERLIN — As U.N. and international humanitarian agencies raise the alarm over the Saudi blockade of aid deliveries to Yemen, European and American officials have remained mostly silent. The few remarks coming out of Western capitals in recent weeks have hardly been messages of support for the Yemenis in the midst of a catastrophic humanitarian crisis — in fact, quite the opposite. Two weeks ago, Britain’s then-Defense Minister Michael Fallon offered a blunt assessment of the government’s view on the controversy. “I have to repeat, sadly, to this committee that obviously other criticism of Saudi Arabia in this Parliament is not helpful,” Fallon told the parliamentary defense committee, to which he defended the planned sale of several fighter jets to Saudi Arabia. (Fallon has since resigned over sexual harassment allegations.) In response to a missile attack from Yemeni territory targeting Saudi Arabia — which triggered the most recent escalation of the crisis — President Trump similarly ignored the plight of civilians in the war-torn country and instead went on to praise U.S. weapons sold to Saudi Arabia. Both the United States and Britain have been making more money with arms sales to Saudi Arabia in recent years than ever before. Human rights critics fear that Saudi Arabia has not only bought their weapons but their acceptance for its policies. Of course Saudi Arabia’s attractiveness to Western countries is not just about arms sales. On Thursday, Downing Street said it would provide Saudi energy giant Aramco with credit guarantees of $2 billion to facilitate trade between the two countries. Britain and the United States are both trying to persuade Aramco to hold its much anticipated IPO (valued at hundreds of billions of dollars) on the London and New York stock exchanges, with President Trump tweeting that such move would be “Important to the United States!” In the United States, the Obama administration similarly suspended the sale of precision guided munitions to Riyadh last year. However, the Trump administration is believed to be working on the resumption of such sales. A separate major U.S. arms export deal to the kingdom was struck in May, and Trump has voiced increasingly strong support for the Saudi leadership ever since. Similarly, Germany is still exporting military equipment to the kingdom, although it now appears to be refraining from direct arms deliveries.\\n\\nIf that’s not MAGA, then I don’t know what is.\\n\\nIf E.U. politicians were determined to implement an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia, parliamentarians would have to persuade the governments of all member states to agree to such a ban. With more than a dozen nations profiting from arms and military equipment exports to the kingdom, the chances of such an embargo being implemented anytime soon are virtually nonexistent. Attempts by nongovernmental organizations to force governments into committing to an embargo enforced by courts have so far also been blocked. Campaigners suffered a major defeat this summer, when London’s high court ruled that Britain was not complicit in alleged war crimes in Yemen by allowing the Saudi military to use its arms. The court refused to say how it came to its conclusion, however, and barred the public from accessing the key evidence.\\n\\nIt always makes sense when you follow the money.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nIf you liked this article and enjoy my work, consider becoming a monthly Patron, or visit our Support Page to show your appreciation for independent content creators.',\n",

The country’s prosecutor office on Wednesday ordered the 712 mayors, who have agreed to help stage the October 1 vote, to be summoned to court as official suspects and called for their arrest in case of a refusal to appear for questioning. Barcelona Mayor Ana Colau, who opposes secession but supports a vote, says she wants to help arrange the referendum but won’t do so without assurances that she and her staff would be acting legally. Spain’s King Felipe VI also entered the fray on Wednesday, stepping up the pressure on Catalonia by vowing that the Spanish constitution “will prevail” over any attempt to break the country apart. In his first comments on the growing political crisis, Felipe said the rights of all Spaniards will be upheld against “whoever steps outside constitutional and statutory law.” Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Barcelona this week to show support for independence.

Organisers said 450,000 people had registered for the event, and Barcelona police later tweeted that 1 million turned up. Polls also show that Catalans are divided on whether they wish to secede from Spain. A survey at the end of July found that 49.4% of Catalans were against independence and 41.1% supported it. Raül Romeva, the Catalan foreign affairs minister, told reporters that the referendum had already begun, with expatriate Catalans voting by post. “You need to remember that people are already voting,” he said. “The Catalan community abroad is already voting.

As a result, the Public Prosecutor’s Office instructed security forces to take everything which could help with the “consummation of the crime”.

       " ('Authored by Nafeez Ahmed via Medium.com,\\n\\nInside the secret network behind mass surveillance, endless war, and Skynet...\\n\\nINSURGE INTELLIGENCE, a new crowd-funded investigative journalism project, breaks the exclusive story of how the United States intelligence community funded, nurtured and incubated Google as part of a drive to dominate the world through control of information. Seed-funded by the NSA and CIA, Google was merely the first among a plethora of private sector start-ups co-opted by US intelligence to retain ‘information superiority.’ The origins of this ingenious strategy trace back to a secret Pentagon-sponsored group, that for the last two decades has functioned as a bridge between the US government and elites across the business, industry, finance, corporate, and media sectors. The group has allowed some of the most powerful special interests in corporate America to systematically circumvent democratic accountability and the rule of law to influence government policies, as well as public opinion in the US and around the world. The results have been catastrophic: NSA mass surveillance, a permanent state of global war, and a new initiative to transform the US military into Skynet. This exclusive is being released for free in the public interest, and was enabled by crowdfunding. I’d like to thank my amazing community of patrons for their support, which gave me the opportunity to work on this in-depth investigation. Please support independent, investigative journalism for the global commons. * * * In the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris, western governments are moving fast to legitimize expanded powers of mass surveillance and controls on the internet, all in the name of fighting terrorism. US and European politicians have called to protect NSA-style snooping, and to advance the capacity to intrude on internet privacy by outlawing encryption. One idea is to establish a telecoms partnership that would unilaterally delete content deemed to “fuel hatred and violence” in situations considered “appropriate.” Heated discussions are going on at government and parliamentary level to explore cracking down on lawyer-client confidentiality. What any of this would have done to prevent the Charlie Hebdo attacks remains a mystery, especially given that we already know the terrorists were on the radar of French intelligence for up to a decade.\\n\\nThere is little new in this story. The 9/11 atrocity was the first of many terrorist attacks, each succeeded by the dramatic extension of draconian state powers at the expense of civil liberties, backed up with the projection of military force in regions identified as hotspots harbouring terrorists. Yet there is little indication that this tried and tested formula has done anything to reduce the danger. If anything, we appear to be locked into a deepening cycle of violence with no clear end in sight. As our governments push to increase their powers, INSURGE INTELLIGENCE can now reveal the vast extent to which the US intelligence community is implicated in nurturing the web platforms we know today, for the precise purpose of utilizing the technology as a mechanism to fight global ‘information war’?—?a war to legitimize the power of the few over the rest of us. The lynchpin of this story is the corporation that in many ways defines the 21st century with its unobtrusive omnipresence: Google. Google styles itself as a friendly, funky, user-friendly tech firm that rose to prominence through a combination of skill, luck, and genuine innovation. This is true. But it is a mere fragment of the story. In reality, Google is a smokescreen behind which lurks the US military-industrial complex. The inside story of Google’s rise, revealed here for the first time, opens a can of worms that goes far beyond Google, unexpectedly shining a light on the existence of a parasitical network driving the evolution of the US national security apparatus, and profiting obscenely from its operation. The shadow network For the last two decades, US foreign and intelligence strategies have resulted in a global ‘war on terror’ consisting of prolonged military invasions in the Muslim world and comprehensive surveillance of civilian populations. These strategies have been incubated, if not dictated, by a secret network inside and beyond the Pentagon. Established under the Clinton administration, consolidated under Bush, and firmly entrenched under Obama, this bipartisan network of mostly neoconservative ideologues sealed its dominion inside the US Department of Defense (DoD) by the dawn of 2015, through the operation of an obscure corporate entity outside the Pentagon, but run by the Pentagon. In 1999, the CIA created its own venture capital investment firm, In-Q-Tel, to fund promising start-ups that might create technologies useful for intelligence agencies. But the inspiration for In-Q-Tel came earlier, when the Pentagon set up its own private sector outfit. Known as the ‘Highlands Forum,’ this private network has operated as a bridge between the Pentagon and powerful American elites outside the military since the mid-1990s. Despite changes in civilian administrations, the network around the Highlands Forum has become increasingly successful in dominating US defense policy. Giant defense contractors like Booz Allen Hamilton and Science Applications International Corporation are sometimes referred to as the ‘shadow intelligence community’ due to the revolving doors between them and government, and their capacity to simultaneously influence and profit from defense policy. But while these contractors compete for power and money, they also collaborate where it counts. The Highlands Forum has for 20 years provided an off the record space for some of the most prominent members of the shadow intelligence community to convene with senior US government officials, alongside other leaders in relevant industries. I first stumbled upon the existence of this network in November 2014, when I reported for VICE’s Motherboard that US defense secretary Chuck Hagel’s newly announced ‘Defense Innovation Initiative’ was really about building Skynet?—?or something like it, essentially to dominate an emerging era of automated robotic warfare. That story was based on a little-known Pentagon-funded ‘white paper’ published two months earlier by the National Defense University (NDU) in Washington DC, a leading US military-run institution that, among other things, generates research to develop US defense policy at the highest levels. The white paper clarified the thinking behind the new initiative, and the revolutionary scientific and technological developments it hoped to capitalize on. The Highlands Forum The co-author of that NDU white paper is Linton Wells, a 51-year veteran US defense official who served in the Bush administration as the Pentagon’s chief information officer, overseeing the National Security Agency (NSA) and other spy agencies. He still holds active top-secret security clearances, and according to a report by Government Executive magazine in 2006 he chaired the ‘Highlands Forum’, founded by the Pentagon in 1994.\\n\\nLinton Wells II (right) former Pentagon chief information officer and assistant secretary of defense for networks, at a recent Pentagon Highlands Forum session. Rosemary Wenchel, a senior official in the US Department of Homeland Security, is sitting next to him\\n\\nNew Scientist magazine (paywall) has compared the Highlands Forum to elite meetings like “Davos, Ditchley and Aspen,” describing it as “far less well known, yet… arguably just as influential a talking shop.” Regular Forum meetings bring together “innovative people to consider interactions between policy and technology. Its biggest successes have been in the development of high-tech network-based warfare.”\\n\\nGiven Wells’ role in such a Forum, perhaps it was not surprising that his defense transformation white paper was able to have such a profound impact on actual Pentagon policy. But if that was the case, why had no one noticed?\\n\\nDespite being sponsored by the Pentagon, I could find no official page on the DoD website about the Forum. Active and former US military and intelligence sources had never heard of it, and neither did national security journalists. I was baffled.\\n\\nThe Pentagon’s intellectual capital venture firm\\n\\nIn the prologue to his 2007 book, A Crowd of One: The Future of Individual Identity, John Clippinger, an MIT scientist of the Media Lab Human Dynamics Group, described how he participated in a “Highlands Forum” gathering, an “invitation-only meeting funded by the Department of Defense and chaired by the assistant for networks and information integration.” This was a senior DoD post overseeing operations and policies for the Pentagon’s most powerful spy agencies including the NSA, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), among others. Starting from 2003, the position was transitioned into what is now the undersecretary of defense for intelligence. The Highlands Forum, Clippinger wrote, was founded by a retired US Navy captain named Dick O’Neill. Delegates include senior US military officials across numerous agencies and divisions?—?“captains, rear admirals, generals, colonels, majors and commanders” as well as “members of the DoD leadership.”\\n\\nWhat at first appeared to be the Forum’s main website describes Highlands as “an informal cross-disciplinary network sponsored by Federal Government,” focusing on “information, science and technology.” Explanation is sparse, beyond a single ‘Department of Defense’ logo.\\n\\nBut Highlands also has another website describing itself as an “intellectual capital venture firm” with “extensive experience assisting corporations, organizations, and government leaders.” The firm provides a “wide range of services, including: strategic planning, scenario creation and gaming for expanding global markets,” as well as “working with clients to build strategies for execution.” ‘The Highlands Group Inc.,’ the website says, organizes a whole range of Forums on these issue.\\n\\nFor instance, in addition to the Highlands Forum, since 9/11 the Group runs the ‘Island Forum,’ an international event held in association with Singapore’s Ministry of Defense, which O’Neill oversees as “lead consultant.” The Singapore Ministry of Defense website describes the Island Forum as “patterned after the Highlands Forum organized for the US Department of Defense.” Documents leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden confirmed that Singapore played a key role in permitting the US and Australia to tap undersea cables to spy on Asian powers like Indonesia and Malaysia.\\n\\nThe Highlands Group website also reveals that Highlands is partnered with one of the most powerful defense contractors in the United States. Highlands is “supported by a network of companies and independent researchers,” including “our Highlands Forum partners for the past ten years at SAIC; and the vast Highlands network of participants in the Highlands Forum.”\\n\\nSAIC stands for the US defense firm, Science Applications International Corporation, which changed its name to Leidos in 2013, operating SAIC as a subsidiary. SAIC/Leidos is among the top 10 largest defense contractors in the US, and works closely with the US intelligence community, especially the NSA. According to investigative journalist Tim Shorrock, the first to disclose the vast extent of the privatization of US intelligence with his seminal book Spies for Hire, SAIC has a “symbiotic relationship with the NSA: the agency is the company’s largest single customer and SAIC is the NSA’s largest contractor.”\\n\\nRichard ‘Dick’ Patrick O’Neill, founding president of the Pentagon’s Highlands Forum\\n\\nThe full name of Captain “Dick” O’Neill, the founding president of the Highlands Forum, is Richard Patrick O’Neill, who after his work in the Navy joined the DoD. He served his last post as deputy for strategy and policy in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, before setting up Highlands.\\n\\nThe Club of Yoda\\n\\nBut Clippinger also referred to another mysterious individual revered by Forum attendees:\\n\\n“He sat at the back of the room, expressionless behind thick, black-rimmed glasses. I never heard him utter a word… Andrew (Andy) Marshall is an icon within DoD. Some call him Yoda, indicative of his mythical inscrutable status… He had served many administrations and was widely regarded as above partisan politics. He was a supporter of the Highlands Forum and a regular fixture from its beginning.”\\n\\nSince 1973, Marshall has headed up one of the Pentagon’s most powerful agencies, the Office of Net Assessment (ONA), the US defense secretary’s internal ‘think tank’ which conducts highly classified research on future planning for defense policy across the US military and intelligence community. The ONA has played a key role in major Pentagon strategy initiatives, including Maritime Strategy, the Strategic Defense Initiative, the Competitive Strategies Initiative, and the Revolution in Military Affairs.\\n\\nAndrew ‘Yoda’ Marshall, head of the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment (ONA) and co-chair of the Highlands Forum, at an early Highlands event in 1996 at the Santa Fe Institute. Marshall is retiring as of January 2015\\n\\nIn a rare 2002 profile in Wired, reporter Douglas McGray described Andrew Marshall, now 93 years old, as “the DoD’s most elusive” but “one of its most influential” officials. McGray added that “Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz”?—?widely considered the hawks of the neoconservative movement in American politics?—?were among Marshall’s “star protégés.”\\n\\nSpeaking at a low-key Harvard University seminar a few months after 9/11, Highlands Forum founding president Richard O’Neill said that Marshall was much more than a “regular fixture” at the Forum. “Andy Marshall is our co-chair, so indirectly everything that we do goes back into Andy’s system,” he told the audience. “Directly, people who are in the Forum meetings may be going back to give briefings to Andy on a variety of topics and to synthesize things.” He also said that the Forum had a third co-chair: the director of the Defense Advanced Research and Projects Agency (DARPA), which at that time was a Rumsfeld appointee, Anthony J. Tether. Before joining DARPA, Tether was vice president of SAIC’s Advanced Technology Sector.\\n\\nAnthony J. Tether, director of DARPA and co-chair of the Pentagon’s Highlands Forum from June 2001 to February 2009\\n\\nThe Highlands Forum’s influence on US defense policy has thus operated through three main channels: its sponsorship by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (around the middle of last decade this was transitioned specifically to the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence, which is in charge of the main surveillance agencies); its direct link to Andrew ‘Yoda’ Marshall’s ONA; and its direct link to DARPA.\\n\\nA slide from Richard O’Neill’s presentation at Harvard University in 2001\\n\\nAccording to Clippinger in A Crowd of One, “what happens at informal gatherings such as the Highlands Forum could, over time and through unforeseen curious paths of influence, have enormous impact, not just within the DoD but throughout the world.” He wrote that the Forum’s ideas have “moved from being heretical to mainstream. Ideas that were anathema in 1999 had been adopted as policy just three years later.”\\n\\nAlthough the Forum does not produce “consensus recommendations,” its impact is deeper than a traditional government advisory committee. “The ideas that emerge from meetings are available for use by decision-makers as well as by people from the think tanks,” according to O’Neill:\\n\\n“We’ll include people from Booz, SAIC, RAND, or others at our meetings… We welcome that kind of cooperation, because, truthfully, they have the gravitas. They are there for the long haul and are able to influence government policies with real scholarly work… We produce ideas and interaction and networks for these people to take and use as they need them.”\\n\\nMy repeated requests to O’Neill for information on his work at the Highlands Forum were ignored. The Department of Defense also did not respond to multiple requests for information and comment on the Forum.\\n\\nInformation warfare\\n\\nThe Highlands Forum has served as a two-way ‘influence bridge’: on the one hand, for the shadow network of private contractors to influence the formulation of information operations policy across US military intelligence; and on the other, for the Pentagon to influence what is going on in the private sector. There is no clearer evidence of this than the truly instrumental role of the Forum in incubating the idea of mass surveillance as a mechanism to dominate information on a global scale.\\n\\nIn 1989, Richard O’Neill, then a US Navy cryptologist, wrote a paper for the US Naval War College, ‘Toward a methodology for perception management.’ In his book, Future Wars, Col. John Alexander, then a senior officer in the US Army’s Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM), records that O’Neill’s paper for the first time outlined a strategy for “perception management” as part of information warfare (IW). O’Neill’s proposed strategy identified three categories of targets for IW: adversaries, so they believe they are vulnerable; potential partners, “so they perceive the cause [of war] as just”; and finally, civilian populations and the political leadership so they “perceive the cost as worth the effort.” A secret briefing based on O’Neill’s work “made its way to the top leadership” at DoD. “They acknowledged that O’Neill was right and told him to bury it.\\n\\nExcept the DoD didn’t bury it. Around 1994, the Highlands Group was founded by O’Neill as an official Pentagon project at the appointment of Bill Clinton’s then defense secretary William Perry?—?who went on to join SAIC’s board of directors after retiring from government in 2003.\\n\\nIn O’Neill’s own words, the group would function as the Pentagon’s ‘ideas lab’. According to Government Executive, military and information technology experts gathered at the first Forum meeting “to consider the impacts of IT and globalization on the United States and on warfare. How would the Internet and other emerging technologies change the world?” The meeting helped plant the idea of “network-centric warfare” in the minds of “the nation’s top military thinkers.”\\n\\nExcluding the public\\n\\nOfficial Pentagon records confirm that the Highlands Forum’s primary goal was to support DoD policies on O’Neill’s specialism: information warfare. According to the Pentagon’s 1997 Annual Report to the President and the Congress under a section titled ‘Information Operations,’ (IO) the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) had authorized the “establishment of the Highlands Group of key DoD, industry, and academic IO experts” to coordinate IO across federal military intelligence agencies.\\n\\nThe following year’s DoD annual report reiterated the Forum’s centrality to information operations: “To examine IO issues, DoD sponsors the Highlands Forum, which brings together government, industry, and academic professionals from various fields.”\\n\\nNotice that in 1998, the Highlands ‘Group’ became a ‘Forum.’ According to O’Neill, this was to avoid subjecting Highlands Forums meetings to “bureaucratic restrictions.” What he was alluding to was the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which regulates the way the US government can formally solicit the advice of special interests.\\n\\nKnown as the ‘open government’ law, FACA requires that US government officials cannot hold closed-door or secret consultations with people outside government to develop policy. All such consultations should take place via federal advisory committees that permit public scrutiny. FACA requires that meetings be held in public, announced via the Federal Register, that advisory groups are registered with an office at the General Services Administration, among other requirements intended to maintain accountability to the public interest.\\n\\nBut Government Executive reported that “O’Neill and others believed” such regulatory issues “would quell the free flow of ideas and no-holds-barred discussions they sought.” Pentagon lawyers had warned that the word ‘group’ might necessitate certain obligations and advised running the whole thing privately: “So O’Neill renamed it the Highlands Forum and moved into the private sector to manage it as a consultant to the Pentagon.” The Pentagon Highlands Forum thus runs under the mantle of O’Neill’s ‘intellectual capital venture firm,’ ‘Highlands Group Inc.’\\n\\nIn 1995, a year after William Perry appointed O’Neill to head up the Highlands Forum, SAIC?—?the Forum’s “partner” organization?—?launched a new Center for Information Strategy and Policy under the direction of “Jeffrey Cooper, a member of the Highlands Group who advises senior Defense Department officials on information warfare issues.” The Center had precisely the same objective as the Forum, to function as “a clearinghouse to bring together the best and brightest minds in information warfare by sponsoring a continuing series of seminars, papers and symposia which explore the implications of information warfare in depth.” The aim was to “enable leaders and policymakers from government, industry, and academia to address key issues surrounding information warfare to ensure that the United States retains its edge over any and all potential enemies.”\\n\\nDespite FACA regulations, federal advisory committees are already heavily influenced, if not captured, by corporate power. So in bypassing FACA, the Pentagon overrode even the loose restrictions of FACA, by permanently excluding any possibility of public engagement.\\n\\nO’Neill’s claim that there are no reports or recommendations is disingenuous. By his own admission, the secret Pentagon consultations with industry that have taken place through the Highlands Forum since 1994 have been accompanied by regular presentations of academic and policy papers, recordings and notes of meetings, and other forms of documentation that are locked behind a login only accessible by Forum delegates. This violates the spirit, if not the letter, of FACA?—?in a way that is patently intended to circumvent democratic accountability and the rule of law.\\n\\nThe Highlands Forum doesn’t need to produce consensus recommendations. Its purpose is to provide the Pentagon a shadow social networking mechanism to cement lasting relationships with corporate power, and to identify new talent, that can be used to fine-tune information warfare strategies in absolute secrecy.\\n\\nTotal participants in the DoD’s Highlands Forum number over a thousand, although sessions largely consist of small closed workshop style gatherings of maximum 25–30 people, bringing together experts and officials depending on the subject. Delegates have included senior personnel from SAIC and Booz Allen Hamilton, RAND Corp., Cisco, Human Genome Sciences, eBay, PayPal, IBM, Google, Microsoft, AT&T, the BBC, Disney, General Electric, Enron, among innumerable others; Democrat and Republican members of Congress and the Senate; senior executives from the US energy industry such as Daniel Yergin of IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates; and key people involved in both sides of presidential campaigns.\\n\\nOther participants have included senior media professionals: David Ignatius, associate editor of the Washington Post and at the time the executive editor of the International Herald Tribune; Thomas Friedman, long-time New York Times columnist; Arnaud de Borchgrave, an editor at Washington Times and United Press International; Steven Levy, a former Newsweek editor, senior writer for Wired and now chief tech editor at Medium; Lawrence Wright, staff writer at the New Yorker; Noah Shachtmann, executive editor at the Daily Beast; Rebecca McKinnon, co-founder of Global Voices Online; Nik Gowing of the BBC; and John Markoff of the New York Times.\\n\\nDue to its current sponsorship by the OSD’s undersecretary of defense for intelligence, the Forum has inside access to the chiefs of the main US surveillance and reconnaissance agencies, as well as the directors and their assistants at DoD research agencies, from DARPA, to the ONA. This also means that the Forum is deeply plugged into the Pentagon’s policy research task forces.\\n\\nGoogle: seeded by the Pentagon\\n\\nIn 1994?—?the same year the Highlands Forum was founded under the stewardship of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the ONA, and DARPA?—?two young PhD students at Stanford University, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, made their breakthrough on the first automated web crawling and page ranking application. That application remains the core component of what eventually became Google’s search service. Brin and Page had performed their work with funding from the Digital Library Initiative (DLI), a multi-agency programme of the National Science Foundation (NSF), NASA and DARPA.\\n\\nBut that’s just one side of the story.\\n\\nThroughout the development of the search engine, Sergey Brin reported regularly and directly to two people who were not Stanford faculty at all: Dr. Bhavani Thuraisingham and Dr. Rick Steinheiser. Both were representatives of a sensitive US intelligence community research programme on information security and data-mining.\\n\\nThuraisingham is currently the Louis A. Beecherl distinguished professor and executive director of the Cyber Security Research Institute at the University of Texas, Dallas, and a sought-after expert on data-mining, data management and information security issues. But in the 1990s, she worked for the MITRE Corp., a leading US defense contractor, where she managed the Massive Digital Data Systems initiative, a project sponsored by the NSA, CIA, and the Director of Central Intelligence, to foster innovative research in information technology.\\n\\n“We funded Stanford University through the computer scientist Jeffrey Ullman, who had several promising graduate students working on many exciting areas,” Prof. Thuraisingham told me. “One of them was Sergey Brin, the founder of Google. The intelligence community’s MDDS program essentially provided Brin seed-funding, which was supplemented by many other sources, including the private sector.”\\n\\nThis sort of funding is certainly not unusual, and Sergey Brin’s being able to receive it by being a graduate student at Stanford appears to have been incidental. The Pentagon was all over computer science research at this time. But it illustrates how deeply entrenched the culture of Silicon Valley is in the values of the US intelligence community.\\n\\nIn an extraordinary document hosted by the website of the University of Texas, Thuraisingham recounts that from 1993 to 1999, “the Intelligence Community [IC] started a program called Massive Digital Data Systems (MDDS) that I was managing for the Intelligence Community when I was at the MITRE Corporation.” The program funded 15 research efforts at various universities, including Stanford. Its goal was developing “data management technologies to manage several terabytes to petabytes of data,” including for “query processing, transaction management, metadata management, storage management, and data integration.”\\n\\nAt the time, Thuraisingham was chief scientist for data and information management at MITRE, where she led team research and development efforts for the NSA, CIA, US Air Force Research Laboratory, as well as the US Navy’s Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) and Communications and Electronic Command (CECOM). She went on to teach courses for US government officials and defense contractors on data-mining in counter-terrorism.\\n\\nIn her University of Texas article, she attaches the copy of an abstract of the US intelligence community’s MDDS program that had been presented to the “Annual Intelligence Community Symposium” in 1995. The abstract reveals that the primary sponsors of the MDDS programme were three agencies: the NSA, the CIA’s Office of Research & Development, and the intelligence community’s Community Management Staff (CMS) which operates under the Director of Central Intelligence. Administrators of the program, which provided funding of around 3–4 million dollars per year for 3–4 years, were identified as Hal Curran (NSA), Robert Kluttz (CMS), Dr. Claudia Pierce (NSA), Dr. Rick Steinheiser (ORD?—?standing for the CIA’s Office of Research and Devepment), and Dr. Thuraisingham herself.\\n\\nThuraisingham goes on in her article to reiterate that this joint CIA-NSA program partly funded Sergey Brin to develop the core of Google, through a grant to Stanford managed by Brin’s supervisor Prof. Jeffrey D. Ullman:\\n\\n“In fact, the Google founder Mr. Sergey Brin was partly funded by this program while he was a PhD student at Stanford. He together with his advisor Prof. Jeffrey Ullman and my colleague at MITRE, Dr. Chris Clifton [Mitre’s chief scientist in IT], developed the Query Flocks System which produced solutions for mining large amounts of data stored in databases. I remember visiting Stanford with Dr. Rick Steinheiser from the Intelligence Community and Mr. Brin would rush in on roller blades, give his presentation and rush out. In fact the last time we met in September 1998, Mr. Brin demonstrated to us his search engine which became Google soon after.”\\n\\nBrin and Page officially incorporated Google as a company in September 1998, the very month they last reported to Thuraisingham and Steinheiser. ‘Query Flocks’ was also part of Google’s patented ‘PageRank’ search system, which Brin developed at Stanford under the CIA-NSA-MDDS programme, as well as with funding from the NSF, IBM and Hitachi. That year, MITRE’s Dr. Chris Clifton, who worked under Thuraisingham to develop the ‘Query Flocks’ system, co-authored a paper with Brin’s superviser, Prof. Ullman, and the CIA’s Rick Steinheiser. Titled ‘Knowledge Discovery in Text,’ the paper was presented at an academic conference.\\n\\n“The MDDS funding that supported Brin was significant as far as seed-funding goes, but it was probably outweighed by the other funding streams,” said Thuraisingham. “The duration of Brin’s funding was around two years or so. In that period, I and my colleagues from the MDDS would visit Stanford to see Brin and monitor his progress every three months or so. We didn’t supervise exactly, but we did want to check progress, point out potential problems and suggest ideas. In those briefings, Brin did present to us on the query flocks research, and also demonstrated to us versions of the Google search engine.”\\n\\nBrin thus reported to Thuraisingham and Steinheiser regularly about his work developing Google.\\n\\n==\\n\\nUPDATE 2.05PM GMT [2nd Feb 2015]: Since publication of this article, Prof. Thuraisingham has amended her article referenced above. The amended version includes a new modified statement, followed by a copy of the original version of her account of the MDDS. In this amended version, Thuraisingham rejects the idea that CIA funded Google, and says instead: “In fact Prof. Jeffrey Ullman (at Stanford) and my colleague at MITRE Dr. Chris Clifton together with some others developed the Query Flocks System, as part of MDDS, which produced solutions for mining large amounts of data stored in databases. Also, Mr. Sergey Brin, the cofounder of Google, was part of Prof. Ullman’s research group at that time. I remember visiting Stanford with Dr. Rick Steinheiser from the Intelligence Community periodically and Mr. Brin would rush in on roller blades, give his presentation and rush out. During our last visit to Stanford in September 1998, Mr. Brin demonstrated to us his search engine which I believe became Google soon after… There are also several inaccuracies in Dr. Ahmed’s article (dated January 22, 2015). For example, the MDDS program was not a ‘sensitive’ program as stated by Dr. Ahmed; it was an Unclassified program that funded universities in the US. Furthermore, Sergey Brin never reported to me or to Dr. Rick Steinheiser; he only gave presentations to us during our visits to the Department of Computer Science at Stanford during the 1990s. Also, MDDS never funded Google; it funded Stanford University.” Here, there is no substantive factual difference in Thuraisingham’s accounts, other than to assert that her statement associating Sergey Brin with the development of ‘query flocks’ is mistaken. Notably, this acknowledgement is derived not from her own knowledge, but from this very article quoting a comment from a Google spokesperson. However, the bizarre attempt to disassociate Google from the MDDS program misses the mark. Firstly, the MDDS never funded Google, because during the development of the core components of the Google search engine, there was no company incorporated with that name. The grant was instead provided to Stanford University through Prof. Ullman, through whom some MDDS funding was used to support Brin who was co-developing Google at the time. Secondly, Thuraisingham then adds that Brin never “reported” to her or the CIA’s Steinheiser, but admits he “gave presentations to us during our visits to the Department of Computer Science at Stanford during the 1990s.” It is unclear, though, what the distinction is here between reporting, and delivering a detailed presentation?—?either way, Thuraisingham confirms that she and the CIA had taken a keen interest in Brin’s development of Google. Thirdly, Thuraisingham describes the MDDS program as “unclassified,” but this does not contradict its “sensitive” nature. As someone who has worked for decades as an intelligence contractor and advisor, Thuraisingham is surely aware that there are many ways of categorizing intelligence, including ‘sensitive but unclassified.’ A number of former US intelligence officials I spoke to said that the almost total lack of public information on the CIA and NSA’s MDDS initiative suggests that although the progam was not classified, it is likely instead that its contents was considered sensitive, which would explain efforts to minimise transparency about the program and the way it fed back into developing tools for the US intelligence community. Fourthly, and finally, it is important to point out that the MDDS abstract which Thuraisingham includes in her University of Texas document states clearly not only that the Director of Central Intelligence’s CMS, CIA and NSA were the overseers of the MDDS initiative, but that the intended customers of the project were “DoD, IC, and other government organizations”: the Pentagon, the US intelligence community, and other relevant US government agencies. In other words, the provision of MDDS funding to Brin through Ullman, under the oversight of Thuraisingham and Steinheiser, was fundamentally because they recognized the potential utility of Brin’s work developing Google to the Pentagon, intelligence community, and the federal government at large.\\n\\n==\\n\\nThe MDDS programme is actually referenced in several papers co-authored by Brin and Page while at Stanford, specifically highlighting its role in financially sponsoring Brin in the development of Google. In their 1998 paper published in the Bulletin of the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committeee on Data Engineering, they describe the automation of methods to extract information from the web via “Dual Iterative Pattern Relation Extraction,” the development of “a global ranking of Web pages called PageRank,” and the use of PageRank “to develop a novel search engine called Google.” Through an opening footnote, Sergey Brin confirms he was “Partially supported by the Community Management Staff’s Massive Digital Data Systems Program, NSF grant IRI-96–31952”?—?confirming that Brin’s work developing Google was indeed partly-funded by the CIA-NSA-MDDS program.\\n\\nThis NSF grant identified alongside the MDDS, whose project report lists Brin among the students supported (without mentioning the MDDS), was different to the NSF grant to Larry Page that included funding from DARPA and NASA. The project report, authored by Brin’s supervisor Prof. Ullman, goes on to say under the section ‘Indications of Success’ that “there are some new stories of startups based on NSF-supported research.” Under ‘Project Impact,’ the report remarks: “Finally, the google project has also gone commercial as Google.com.”\\n\\nThuraisingham’s account, including her new amended version, therefore demonstrates that the CIA-NSA-MDDS program was not only partly funding Brin throughout his work with Larry Page developing Google, but that senior US intelligence representatives including a CIA official oversaw the evolution of Google in this pre-launch phase, all the way until the company was ready to be officially founded. Google, then, had been enabled with a “significant” amount of seed-funding and oversight from the Pentagon: namely, the CIA, NSA, and DARPA.\\n\\nThe DoD could not be reached for comment.\\n\\nWhen I asked Prof. Ullman to confirm whether or not Brin was partly funded under the intelligence community’s MDDS program, and whether Ullman was aware that Brin was regularly briefing the CIA’s Rick Steinheiser on his progress in developing the Google search engine, Ullman’s responses were evasive: “May I know whom you represent and why you are interested in these issues? Who are your ‘sources’?” He also denied that Brin played a significant role in developing the ‘query flocks’ system, although it is clear from Brin’s papers that he did draw on that work in co-developing the PageRank system with Page.\\n\\nWhen I asked Ullman whether he was denying the US intelligence community’s role in supporting Brin during the development of Google, he said: “I am not going to dignify this nonsense with a denial. If you won’t explain what your theory is, and what point you are trying to make, I am not going to help you in the slightest.”\\n\\nThe MDDS abstract published online at the University of Texas confirms that the rationale for the CIA-NSA project was to “provide seed money to develop data management technologies which are of high-risk and high-pay-off,” including techniques for “querying, browsing, and filtering; transaction processing; accesses methods and indexing; metadata management and data modelling; and integrating heterogeneous databases; as well as developing appropriate architectures.” The ultimate vision of the program was to “provide for the seamless access and fusion of massive amounts of data, information and knowledge in a heterogeneous, real-time environment” for use by the Pentagon, intelligence community and potentially across government.\\n\\nThese revelations corroborate the claims of Robert Steele, former senior CIA officer and a founding civilian deputy director of the Marine Corps Intelligence Activity, whom I interviewed for The Guardian last year on open source intelligence. Citing sources at the CIA, Steele had said in 2006 that Steinheiser, an old colleague of his, was the CIA’s main liaison at Google and had arranged early funding for the pioneering IT firm. At the time, Wired founder John Batelle managed to get this official denial from a Google spokesperson in response to Steele’s assertions:\\n\\n“The statements related to Google are completely untrue.”\\n\\nThis time round, despite multiple requests and conversations, a Google spokesperson declined to comment.\\n\\nUPDATE: As of 5.41PM GMT [22nd Jan 2015], Google’s director of corporate communication got in touch and asked me to include the following statement: “Sergey Brin was not part of the Query Flocks Program at Stanford, nor were any of his projects funded by US Intelligence bodies.” This is what I wrote back: My response to that statement would be as follows: Brin himself in his own paper acknowledges funding from the Community Management Staff of the Massive Digital Data Systems (MDDS) initiative, which was supplied through the NSF. The MDDS was an intelligence community program set up by the CIA and NSA. I also have it on record, as noted in the piece, from Prof. Thuraisingham of University of Texas that she managed the MDDS program on behalf of the US intelligence community, and that her and the CIA’s Rick Steinheiser met Brin every three months or so for two years to be briefed on his progress developing Google and PageRank. Whether Brin worked on query flocks or not is neither here nor there.\\n\\nIn that context, you might want to consider the following questions:\\n\\n1) Does Google deny that Brin’s work was part-funded by the MDDS via an NSF grant? 2) Does Google deny that Brin reported regularly to Thuraisingham and Steinheiser from around 1996 to 1998 until September that year when he presented the Google search engine to them?\\n\\nTotal Information Awareness\\n\\nA call for papers for the MDDS was sent out via email list on November 3rd 1993 from senior US intelligence official David Charvonia, director of the research and development coordination office of the intelligence community’s CMS. The reaction from Tatu Ylonen (celebrated inventor of the widely used secure shell [SSH] data protection protocol) to his colleagues on the email list is telling: “Crypto relevance? Makes you think whether you should protect your data.” The email also confirms that defense contractor and Highlands Forum partner, SAIC, was managing the MDDS submission process, with abstracts to be sent to Jackie Booth of the CIA’s Office of Research and Development via a SAIC email address.\\n\\nBy 1997, Thuraisingham reveals, shortly before Google became incorporated and while she was still overseeing the development of its search engine software at Stanford, her thoughts turned to the national security applications of the MDDS program. In the acknowledgements to her book, Web Data Mining and Applications in Business Intelligence and Counter-Terrorism (2003), Thuraisingham writes that she and “Dr. Rick Steinheiser of the CIA, began discussions with Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency on applying data-mining for counter-terrorism,” an idea that resulted directly from the MDDS program which partly funded Google. “These discussions eventually developed into the current EELD (Evidence Extraction and Link Detection) program at DARPA.”\\n\\nSo the very same senior CIA official and CIA-NSA contractor involved in providing the seed-funding for Google were simultaneously contemplating the role of data-mining for counter-terrorism purposes, and were developing ideas for tools actually advanced by DARPA.\\n\\nToday, as illustrated by her recent oped in the New York Times, Thuraisingham remains a staunch advocate of data-mining for counter-terrorism purposes, but also insists that these methods must be developed by government in cooperation with civil liberties lawyers and privacy advocates to ensure that robust procedures are in place to prevent potential abuse. She points out, damningly, that with the quantity of information being collected, there is a high risk of false positives.\\n\\nIn 1993, when the MDDS program was launched and managed by MITRE Corp. on behalf of the US intelligence community, University of Virginia computer scientist Dr. Anita K. Jones?—?a MITRE trustee?—?landed the job of DARPA director and head of research and engineering across the Pentagon. She had been on the board of MITRE since 1988. From 1987 to 1993, Jones simultaneously served on SAIC’s board of directors. As the new head of DARPA from 1993 to 1997, she also co-chaired the Pentagon’s Highlands Forum during the period of Google’s pre-launch development at Stanford under the MDSS.\\n\\nThus, when Thuraisingham and Steinheiser were talking to DARPA about the counter-terrorism applications of MDDS research, Jones was DARPA director and Highlands Forum co-chair. That year, Jones left DARPA to return to her post at the University of Virgina. The following year, she joined the board of the National Science Foundation, which of course had also just funded Brin and Page, and also returned to the board of SAIC. When she left DoD, Senator Chuck Robb paid Jones the following tribute : “She brought the technology and operational military communities together to design detailed plans to sustain US dominance on the battlefield into the next century.”\\n\\nDr. Anita Jones, head of DARPA from 1993–1997, and co-chair of the Pentagon Highlands Forum from 1995–1997, during which officials in charge of the CIA-NSA-MDSS program were funding Google, and in communication with DARPA about data-mining for counterterrorism\\n\\nOn the board of the National Science Foundation from 1992 to 1998 (including a stint as chairman from 1996) was Richard N. Zare. This was the period in which the NSF sponsored Sergey Brin and Larry Page in association with DARPA. In June 1994, Prof. Zare, a chemist at Stanford, participated with Prof. Jeffrey Ullman (who supervised Sergey Brin’s research), on a panel sponsored by Stanford and the National Research Council discussing the need for scientists to show how their work “ties to national needs.” The panel brought together scientists and policymakers, including “Washington insiders.”\\n\\nDARPA’s EELD program, inspired by the work of Thuraisingham and Steinheiser under Jones’ watch, was rapidly adapted and integrated with a suite of tools to conduct comprehensive surveillance under the Bush administration.\\n\\nAccording to DARPA official Ted Senator, who led the EELD program for the agency’s short-lived Information Awareness Office, EELD was among a range of “promising techniques” being prepared for integration “into the prototype TIA system.” TIA stood for Total Information Awareness, and was the main global electronic eavesdropping and data-mining program deployed by the Bush administration after 9/11. TIA had been set up by Iran-Contra conspirator Admiral John Poindexter, who was appointed in 2002 by Bush to lead DARPA’s new Information Awareness Office.\\n\\nThe Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) was another contractor among 26 companies (also including SAIC) that received million dollar contracts from DARPA (the specific quantities remained classified) under Poindexter, to push forward the TIA surveillance program in 2002 onwards. The research included “behaviour-based profiling,” “automated detection, identification and tracking” of terrorist activity, among other data-analyzing projects. At this time, PARC’s director and chief scientist was John Seely Brown. Both Brown and Poindexter were Pentagon Highlands Forum participants?—?Brown on a regular basis until recently.\\n\\nTIA was purportedly shut down in 2003 due to public opposition after the program was exposed in the media, but the following year Poindexter participated in a Pentagon Highlands Group session in Singapore, alongside defense and security officials from around the world. Meanwhile, Ted Senator continued to manage the EELD program among other data-mining and analysis projects at DARPA until 2006, when he left to become a vice president at SAIC. He is now a SAIC/Leidos technical fellow.\\n\\nGoogle, DARPA and the money trail\\n\\nLong before the appearance of Sergey Brin and Larry Page, Stanford University’s computer science department had a close working relationship with US military intelligence. A letter dated November 5th 1984 from the office of renowned artificial intelligence (AI) expert, Prof Edward Feigenbaum, addressed to Rick Steinheiser, gives the latter directions to Stanford’s Heuristic Programming Project, addressing Steinheiser as a member of the “AI Steering Committee.” A list of attendees at a contractor conference around that time, sponsored by the Pentagon’s Office of Naval Research (ONR), includes Steinheiser as a delegate under the designation “OPNAV Op-115”?—?which refers to the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations’ program on operational readiness, which played a major role in advancing digital systems for the military.\\n\\nFrom the 1970s, Prof. Feigenbaum and his colleagues had been running Stanford’s Heuristic Programming Project under contract with DARPA, continuing through to the 1990s. Feigenbaum alone had received around over $7 million in this period for his work from DARPA, along with other funding from the NSF, NASA, and ONR.\\n\\nBrin’s supervisor at Stanford, Prof. Jeffrey Ullman, was in 1996 part of a joint funding project of DARPA’s Intelligent Integration of Information program. That year, Ullman co-chaired DARPA-sponsored meetings on data exchange between multiple systems.\\n\\nIn September 1998, the same month that Sergey Brin briefed US intelligence representatives Steinheiser and Thuraisingham, tech entrepreneurs Andreas Bechtolsheim and David Cheriton invested $100,000 each in Google. Both investors were connected to DARPA.\\n\\nAs a Stanford PhD student in electrical engineering in the 1980s, Bechtolsheim’s pioneering SUN workstation project had been funded by DARPA and the Stanford computer science department?—?this research was the foundation of Bechtolsheim’s establishment of Sun Microsystems, which he co-founded with William Joy.\\n\\nAs for Bechtolsheim’s co-investor in Google, David Cheriton, the latter is a long-time Stanford computer science professor who has an even more entrenched relationship with DARPA. His bio at the University of Alberta, which in November 2014 awarded him an honorary science doctorate, says that Cheriton’s “research has received the support of the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for over 20 years.”\\n\\nIn the meantime, Bechtolsheim left Sun Microsystems in 1995, co-founding Granite Systems with his fellow Google investor Cheriton as a partner. They sold Granite to Cisco Systems in 1996, retaining significant ownership of Granite, and becoming senior Cisco executives.\\n\\nAn email obtained from the Enron Corpus (a database of 600,000 emails acquired by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and later released to the public) from Richard O’Neill, inviting Enron executives to participate in the Highlands Forum, shows that Cisco and Granite executives are intimately connected to the Pentagon. The email reveals that in May 2000, Bechtolsheim’s partner and Sun Microsystems co-founder, William Joy?—?who was then chief scientist and corporate executive officer there?—?had attended the Forum to discuss nanotechnology and molecular computing.\\n\\nIn 1999, Joy had also co-chaired the President’s Information Technology Advisory Committee, overseeing a report acknowledging that DARPA had:\\n\\n“… revised its priorities in the 90’s so that all information technology funding was judged in terms of its benefit to the warfighter.”\\n\\nThroughout the 1990s, then, DARPA’s funding to Stanford, including Google, was explicitly about developing technologies that could augment the Pentagon’s military intelligence operations in war theatres.\\n\\nThe Joy report recommended more federal government funding from the Pentagon, NASA, and other agencies to the IT sector. Greg Papadopoulos, another of Bechtolsheim’s colleagues as then Sun Microsystems chief technology officer, also attended a Pentagon Highlands’ Forum meeting in September 2000.\\n\\nIn November, the Pentagon Highlands Forum hosted Sue Bostrom, who was vice president for the internet at Cisco, sitting on the company’s board alongside Google co-investors Bechtolsheim and Cheriton. The Forum also hosted Lawrence Zuriff, then a managing partner of Granite, which Bechtolsheim and Cheriton had sold to Cisco. Zuriff had previously been an SAIC contractor from 1993 to 1994, working with the Pentagon on national security issues, specifically for Marshall’s Office of Net Assessment. In 1994, both the SAIC and the ONA were, of course, involved in co-establishing the Pentagon Highlands Forum. Among Zuriff’s output during his SAIC tenure was a paper titled ‘Understanding Information War’, delivered at a SAIC-sponsored US Army Roundtable on the Revolution in Military Affairs.\\n\\nAfter Google’s incorporation, the company received $25 million in equity funding in 1999 led by Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. According to Homeland Security Today, “A number of Sequoia-bankrolled start-ups have contracted with the Department of Defense, especially after 9/11 when Sequoia’s Mark Kvamme met with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to discuss the application of emerging technologies to warfighting and intelligence collection.” Similarly, Kleiner Perkins had developed “a close relationship” with In-Q-Tel, the CIA venture capitalist firm that funds start-ups “to advance ‘priority’ technologies of value” to the intelligence community.\\n\\nJohn Doerr, who led the Kleiner Perkins investment in Google obtaining a board position, was a major early investor in Becholshtein’s Sun Microsystems at its launch. He and his wife Anne are the main funders behind Rice University’s Center for Engineering Leadership (RCEL), which in 2009 received $16 million from DARPA for its platform-aware-compilation-environment (PACE) ubiquitous computing R&D program. Doerr also has a close relationship with the Obama administration, which he advised shortly after it took power to ramp up Pentagon funding to the tech industry. In 2013, at the Fortune Brainstorm TECH conference, Doerr applauded “how the DoD’s DARPA funded GPS, CAD, most of the major computer science departments, and of course, the Internet.”\\n\\nFrom inception, in other words, Google was incubated, nurtured and financed by interests that were directly affiliated or closely aligned with the US military intelligence community: many of whom were embedded in the Pentagon Highlands Forum.\\n\\nGoogle captures the Pentagon\\n\\nIn 2003, Google began customizing its search engine under special contract with the CIA for its Intelink Management Office, “overseeing top-secret, secret and sensitive but unclassified intranets for CIA and other IC agencies,” according to Homeland Security Today. That year, CIA funding was also being “quietly” funneled through the National Science Foundation to projects that might help create “new capabilities to combat terrorism through advanced technology.”\\n\\nThe following year, Google bought the firm Keyhole, which had originally been funded by In-Q-Tel. Using Keyhole, Google began developing the advanced satellite mapping software behind Google Earth. Former DARPA director and Highlands Forum co-chair Anita Jones had been on the board of In-Q-Tel at this time, and remains so today.\\n\\nThen in November 2005, In-Q-Tel issued notices to sell $2.2 million of Google stocks. Google’s relationship with US intelligence was further brought to light when an IT contractor told a closed Washington DC conference of intelligence professionals on a not-for-attribution basis that at least one US intelligence agency was working to “leverage Google’s [user] data monitoring” capability as part of an effort to acquire data of “national security intelligence interest.”\\n\\nA photo on Flickr dated March 2007 reveals that Google research director and AI expert Peter Norvig attended a Pentagon Highlands Forum meeting that year in Carmel, California. Norvig’s intimate connection to the Forum as of that year is also corroborated by his role in guest editing the 2007 Forum reading list.\\n\\nThe photo below shows Norvig in conversation with Lewis Shepherd, who at that time was senior technology officer at the Defense Intelligence Agency, responsible for investigating, approving, and architecting “all new hardware/software systems and acquisitions for the Global Defense Intelligence IT Enterprise,” including “big data technologies.” Shepherd now works at Microsoft. Norvig was a computer research scientist at Stanford University in 1991 before joining Bechtolsheim’s Sun Microsystems as senior scientist until 1994, and going on to head up NASA’s computer science division.\\n\\nLewis Shepherd (left), then a senior technology officer at the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency, talking to Peter Norvig (right), renowned expert in artificial intelligence expert and director of research at Google. This photo is from a Highlands Forum meeting in 2007.\\n\\nNorvig shows up on O’Neill’s Google Plus profile as one of his close connections. Scoping the rest of O’Neill’s Google Plus connections illustrates that he is directly connected not just to a wide range of Google executives, but also to some of the biggest names in the US tech community.\\n\\nThose connections include Michele Weslander Quaid, an ex-CIA contractor and former senior Pentagon intelligence official who is now Google’s chief technology officer where she is developing programs to “best fit government agencies’ needs”; Elizabeth Churchill, Google director of user experience; James Kuffner, a humanoid robotics expert who now heads up Google’s robotics division and who introduced the term ‘cloud robotics’; Mark Drapeau, director of innovation engagement for Microsoft’s public sector business; Lili Cheng, general manager of Microsoft’s Future Social Experiences (FUSE) Labs; Jon Udell, Microsoft ‘evangelist’; Cory Ondrejka, vice president of engineering at Facebook; to name just a few.\\n\\nIn 2010, Google signed a multi-billion dollar no-bid contract with the NSA’s sister agency, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). The contract was to use Google Earth for visualization services for the NGA. Google had developed the software behind Google Earth by purchasing Keyhole from the CIA venture firm In-Q-Tel.\\n\\nThen a year after, in 2011, another of O’Neill’s Google Plus connections, Michele Quaid?—?who had served in executive positions at the NGA, National Reconnaissance Office and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence?—?left her government role to become Google ‘innovation evangelist’ and the point-person for seeking government contracts. Quaid’s last role before her move to Google was as a senior representative of the Director of National Intelligence to the Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Task Force, and a senior advisor to the undersecretary of defense for intelligence’s director of Joint and Coalition Warfighter Support (J&CWS). Both roles involved information operations at their core. Before her Google move, in other words, Quaid worked closely with the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence, to which the Pentagon’s Highlands Forum is subordinate. Quaid has herself attended the Forum, though precisely when and how often I could not confirm.\\n\\nIn March 2012, then DARPA director Regina Dugan?—?who in that capacity was also co-chair of the Pentagon Highlands Forum?—?followed her colleague Quaid into Google to lead the company’s new Advanced Technology and Projects Group. During her Pentagon tenure, Dugan led on strategic cyber security and social media, among other initiatives. She was responsible for focusing “an increasing portion” of DARPA’s work “on the investigation of offensive capabilities to address military-specific needs,” securing $500 million of government funding for DARPA cyber research from 2012 to 2017.\\n\\nRegina Dugan, former head of DARPA and Highlands Forum co-chair, now a senior Google executive?—?trying her best to look the part\\n\\nBy November 2014, Google’s chief AI and robotics expert James Kuffner was a delegate alongside O’Neill at the Highlands Island Forum 2014 in Singapore, to explore ‘Advancement in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence: Implications for Society, Security and Conflict.’ The event included 26 delegates from Austria, Israel, Japan, Singapore, Sweden, Britain and the US, from both industry and government. Kuffner’s association with the Pentagon, however, began much earlier. In 1997, Kuffner was a researcher during his Stanford PhD for a Pentagon-funded project on networked autonomous mobile robots, sponsored by DARPA and the US Navy.\\n\\nRumsfeld and persistent surveillance\\n\\nIn sum, many of Google’s most senior executives are affiliated with the Pentagon Highlands Forum, which throughout the period of Google’s growth over the last decade, has surfaced repeatedly as a connecting and convening force. The US intelligence community’s incubation of Google from inception occurred through a combination of direct sponsorship and informal networks of financial influence, themselves closely aligned with Pentagon interests.\\n\\nThe Highlands Forum itself has used the informal relationship building of such private networks to bring together defense and industry sectors, enabling the fusion of corporate and military interests in expanding the covert surveillance apparatus in the name of national security. The power wielded by the shadow network represented in the Forum can, however, be gauged most clearly from its impact during the Bush administration, when it played a direct role in literally writing the strategies and doctrines behind US efforts to achieve ‘information superiority.’\\n\\nIn December 2001, O’Neill confirmed that strategic discussions at the Highlands Forum were feeding directly into Andrew Marshall’s DoD-wide strategic review ordered by President Bush and Donald Rumsfeld to upgrade the military, including the Quadrennial Defense Review?—?and that some of the earliest Forum meetings “resulted in the writing of a group of DoD policies, strategies, and doctrine for the services on information warfare.” That process of “writing” the Pentagon’s information warfare policies “was done in conjunction with people who understood the environment differently?—?not only US citizens, but also foreign citizens, and people who were developing corporate IT.”\\n\\nThe Pentagon’s post-9/11 information warfare doctrines were, then, written not just by national security officials from the US and abroad: but also by powerful corporate entities in the defense and technology sectors.\\n\\nIn April that year, Gen. James McCarthy had completed his defense transformation review ordered by Rumsfeld. His report repeatedly highlighted mass surveillance as integral to DoD transformation. As for Marshall, his follow-up report for Rumsfeld was going to develop a blueprint determining the Pentagon’s future in the ‘information age.’\\n\\nO’Neill also affirmed that to develop information warfare doctrine, the Forum had held extensive discussions on electronic surveillance and “what constitutes an act of war in an information environment.” Papers feeding into US defense policy written through the late 1990s by RAND consultants John Arquilla and David Rondfeldt, both longstanding Highlands Forum members, were produced “as a result of those meetings,” exploring policy dilemmas on how far to take the goal of ‘Information Superiority.’ “One of the things that was shocking to the American public was that we weren’t pilfering Milosevic’s accounts electronically when we in fact could,” commented O’Neill.\\n\\nAlthough the R&D process around the Pentagon transformation strategy remains classified, a hint at the DoD discussions going on in this period can be gleaned from a 2005 US Army School of Advanced Military Studies research monograph in the DoD journal, Military Review, authored by an active Army intelligence officer.\\n\\n“The idea of Persistent Surveillance as a transformational capability has circulated within the national Intelligence Community (IC) and the Department of Defense (DoD) for at least three years,” the paper said, referencing the Rumsfeld-commissioned transformation study.\\n\\nThe Army paper went on to review a range of high-level official military documents, including one from the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, showing that “Persistent Surveillance” was a fundamental theme of the information-centric vision for defense policy across the Pentagon.\\n\\nWe now know that just two months before O’Neill’s address at Harvard in 2001, under the TIA program, President Bush had secretly authorized the NSA’s domestic surveillance of Americans without court-approved warrants, in what appears to have been an illegal modification of the ThinThread data-mining project?—?as later exposed by NSA whistleblowers William Binney and Thomas Drake.\\n\\nThe surveillance-startup nexus\\n\\nFrom here on, Highlands Forum partner SAIC played a key role in the NSA roll out from inception. Shortly after 9/11, Brian Sharkey, chief technology officer of SAIC’s ELS3 Sector (focusing on IT systems for emergency responders), teamed up with John Poindexter to propose the TIA surveillance program. SAIC’s Sharkey had previously been deputy director of the Information Systems Office at DARPA through the 1990s.\\n\\nMeanwhile, around the same time, SAIC vice president for corporate development, Samuel Visner, became head of the NSA’s signals-intelligence programs. SAIC was then among a consortium receiving a $280 million contract to develop one of the NSA’s secret eavesdropping systems. By 2003, Visner returned to SAIC to become director of strategic planning and business development of the firm’s intelligence group.\\n\\nThat year, the NSA consolidated its TIA programme of warrantless electronic surveillance, to keep “track of individuals” and understand “how they fit into models” through risk profiles of American citizens and foreigners. TIA was doing this by integrating databases on finance, travel, medical, educational and other records into a “virtual, centralized grand database.”\\n\\nThis was also the year that the Bush administration drew up its notorious Information Operations Roadmap. Describing the internet as a “vulnerable weapons system,” Rumsfeld’s IO roadmap had advocated that Pentagon strategy “should be based on the premise that the Department [of Defense] will ‘fight the net’ as it would an enemy weapons system.” The US should seek “maximum control” of the “full spectrum of globally emerging communications systems, sensors, and weapons systems,” advocated the document.\\n\\nThe following year, John Poindexter, who had proposed and run the TIA surveillance program via his post at DARPA, was in Singapore participating in the Highlands 2004 Island Forum. Other delegates included then Highlands Forum co-chair and Pentagon CIO Linton Wells; president of notorious Pentagon information warfare contractor, John Rendon; Karl Lowe, director of the Joint Forces Command (JFCOM) Joint Advanced Warfighting Division; Air Vice Marshall Stephen Dalton, capability manager for information superiority at the UK Ministry of Defense; Lt. Gen. Johan Kihl, Swedish army Supreme Commander HQ’s chief of staff; among others.\\n\\nAs of 2006, SAIC had been awarded a multi-million dollar NSA contract to develop a big data-mining project called ExecuteLocus, despite the colossal $1 billion failure of its preceding contract, known as ‘Trailblazer.’ Core components of TIA were being “quietly continued” under “new code names,” according to Foreign Policy’s Shane Harris, but had been concealed “behind the veil of the classified intelligence budget.” The new surveillance program had by then been fully transitioned from DARPA’s jurisdiction to the NSA.\\n\\nThis was also the year of yet another Singapore Island Forum led by Richard O’Neill on behalf of the Pentagon, which included senior defense and industry officials from the US, UK, Australia, France, India and Israel. Participants also included senior technologists from Microsoft, IBM, as well as Gilman Louie, partner at technology investment firm Alsop Louie Partners.\\n\\nGilman Louie is a former CEO of In-Q-Tel?—?the CIA firm investing especially in start-ups developing data mining technology. In-Q-Tel was founded in 1999 by the CIA’s Directorate of Science and Technology, under which the Office of Research and Development (ORD)?—?which was part of the Google-funding MDSS program?—?had operated. The idea was to essentially replace the functions once performed by the ORD, by mobilizing the private sector to develop information technology solutions for the entire intelligence community.\\n\\nLouie had led In-Q-Tel from 1999 until January 2006?—?including when Google bought Keyhole, the In-Q-Tel-funded satellite mapping software. Among his colleagues on In-Q-Tel’s board in this period were former DARPA director and Highlands Forum co-chair Anita Jones (who is still there), as well as founding board member William Perry: the man who had appointed O’Neill to set-up the Highlands Forum in the first place. Joining Perry as a founding In-Q-Tel board member was John Seely Brown, then chief scientist at Xerox Corp and director of its Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) from 1990 to 2002, who is also a long-time senior Highlands Forum member since inception.\\n\\nIn addition to the CIA, In-Q-Tel has also been backed by the FBI, NGA, and Defense Intelligence Agency, among other agencies. More than 60 percent of In-Q-Tel’s investments under Louie’s watch were “in companies that specialize in automatically collecting, sifting through and understanding oceans of information,” according to Medill School of Journalism’s News21, which also noted that Louie himself had acknowledged it was not clear “whether privacy and civil liberties will be protected” by government’s use of these technologies “for national security.”\\n\\nThe transcript of Richard O’Neill’s late 2001 seminar at Harvard shows that the Pentagon Highlands Forum had first engaged Gilman Louie long before the Island Forum, in fact, shortly after 9/11 to explore “what’s going on with In-Q-Tel.” That Forum session focused on how to “take advantage of the speed of the commercial market that wasn’t present inside the science and technology community of Washington” and to understand “the implications for the DoD in terms of the strategic review, the QDR, Hill action, and the stakeholders.” Participants of the meeting included “senior military people,” combatant commanders, “several of the senior flag officers,” some “defense industry people” and various US representatives including Republican Congressman William Mac Thornberry and Democrat Senator Joseph Lieberman.\\n\\nBoth Thornberry and Lieberman are staunch supporters of NSA surveillance, and have consistently acted to rally support for pro-war, pro-surveillance legislation. O’Neill’s comments indicate that the Forum’s role is not just to enable corporate contractors to write Pentagon policy, but to rally political support for government policies adopted through the Forum’s informal brand of shadow networking.\\n\\nRepeatedly, O’Neill told his Harvard audience that his job as Forum president was to scope case studies from real companies across the private sector, like eBay and Human Genome Sciences, to figure out the basis of US ‘Information Superiority’?—?“how to dominate” the information market?—?and leverage this for “what the president and the secretary of defense wanted to do with regard to transformation of the DoD and the strategic review.”\\n\\nBy 2007, a year after the Island Forum meeting that included Gilman Louie, Facebook received its second round of $12.7 million worth of funding from Accel Partners. Accel was headed up by James Breyer, former chair of the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) where Louie also served on the board while still CEO of In-Q-Tel. Both Louie and Breyer had previously served together on the board of BBN Technologies?—?which had recruited ex-DARPA chief and In-Q-Tel trustee Anita Jones.\\n\\nFacebook’s 2008 round of funding was led by Greylock Venture Capital, which invested $27.5 million. The firm’s senior partners include Howard Cox, another former NVCA chair who also sits on the board of In-Q-Tel. Apart from Breyer and Zuckerberg, Facebook’s only other board member is Peter Thiel, co-founder of defense contractor Palantir which provides all sorts of data-mining and visualization technologies to US government, military and intelligence agencies, including the NSA and FBI, and which itself was nurtured to financial viability by Highlands Forum members.\\n\\nPalantir co-founders Thiel and Alex Karp met with John Poindexter in 2004, according to Wired, the same year Poindexter had attended the Highlands Island Forum in Singapore. They met at the home of Richard Perle, another Andrew Marshall acolyte. Poindexter helped Palantir open doors, and to assemble “a legion of advocates from the most influential strata of government.” Thiel had also met with Gilman Louie of In-Q-Tel, securing the backing of the CIA in this early phase.\\n\\nAnd so we come full circle. Data-mining programs like ExecuteLocus and projects linked to it, which were developed throughout this period, apparently laid the groundwork for the new NSA programmes eventually disclosed by Edward Snowden. By 2008, as Facebook received its next funding round from Greylock Venture Capital, documents and whistleblower testimony confirmed that the NSA was effectively resurrecting the TIA project with a focus on Internet data-mining via comprehensive monitoring of e-mail, text messages, and Web browsing.\\n\\nWe also now know thanks to Snowden that the NSA’s XKeyscore ‘Digital Network Intelligence’ exploitation system was designed to allow analysts to search not just Internet databases like emails, online chats and browsing history, but also telephone services, mobile phone audio, financial transactions and global air transport communications?—?essentially the entire global telecommunications grid. Highlands Forum partner SAIC played a key role, among other contractors, in producing and administering the NSA’s XKeyscore, and was recently implicated in NSA hacking of the privacy network Tor.\\n\\nThe Pentagon Highlands Forum was therefore intimately involved in all this as a convening network—but also quite directly. Confirming his pivotal role in the expansion of the US-led global surveillance apparatus, then Forum co-chair, Pentagon CIO Linton Wells, told FedTech magazine in 2009 that he had overseen the NSA’s roll out of “an impressive long-term architecture last summer that will provide increasingly sophisticated security until 2015 or so.”\\n\\nThe Goldman Sachs connection\\n\\nWhen I asked Wells about the Forum’s role in influencing US mass surveillance, he responded only to say he would prefer not to comment and that he no longer leads the group.\\n\\nAs Wells is no longer in government, this is to be expected?—?but he is still connected to Highlands. As of September 2014, after delivering his influential white paper on Pentagon transformation, he joined the Monterey Institute for International Studies (MIIS) Cyber Security Initiative (CySec) as a distinguished senior fellow.\\n\\nSadly, this was not a form of trying to keep busy in retirement. Wells’ move underscored that the Pentagon’s conception of information warfare is not just about surveillance, but about the exploitation of surveillance to influence both government and public opinion.\\n\\nThe MIIS CySec initiative is now formally partnered with the Pentagon Highlands Forum through a Memorandum of Understanding signed with MIIS provost Dr Amy Sands, who sits on the Secretary of State’s International Security Advisory Board. The MIIS CySec website states that the MoU signed with Richard O’Neill:\\n\\n“… paves the way for future joint MIIS CySec-Highlands Group sessions that will explore the impact of technology on security, peace and information engagement. For nearly 20 years the Highlands Group has engaged private sector and government leaders, including the Director of National Intelligence, DARPA, Office of the Secretary of Defense, Office of the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Singaporean Minister of Defence, in creative conversations to frame policy and technology research areas.”\\n\\nWho is the financial benefactor of the new Pentagon Highlands-partnered MIIS CySec initiative? According to the MIIS CySec site, the initiative was launched “through a generous donation of seed funding from George Lee.” George C. Lee is a senior partner at Goldman Sachs, where he is chief information officer of the investment banking division, and chairman of the Global Technology, Media and Telecom (TMT) Group.\\n\\nBut here’s the kicker. In 2011, it was Lee who engineered Facebook’s $50 billion valuation, and previously handled deals for other Highlands-connected tech giants like Google, Microsoft and eBay. Lee’s then boss, Stephen Friedman, a former CEO and chairman of Goldman Sachs, and later senior partner on the firm’s executive board, was a also founding board member of In-Q-Tel alongside Highlands Forum overlord William Perry and Forum member John Seely Brown.\\n\\nIn 2001, Bush appointed Stephen Friedman to the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board, and then to chair that board from 2005 to 2009. Friedman previously served alongside Paul Wolfowitz and others on the 1995–6 presidential commission of inquiry into US intelligence capabilities, and in 1996 on the Jeremiah Panel that produced a report to the Director of the National Reconnaisance Office (NRO)?—?one of the surveillance agencies plugged into the Highlands Forum. Friedman was on the Jeremiah Panel with Martin Faga, then senior vice president and general manager of MITRE Corp’s Center for Integrated Intelligence Systems?—?where Thuraisingham, who managed the CIA-NSA-MDDS program that inspired DARPA counter-terrorist data-mining, was also a lead engineer.\\n\\nIn the footnotes to a chapter for the book, Cyberspace and National Security (Georgetown University Press), SAIC/Leidos executive Jeff Cooper reveals that another Goldman Sachs senior partner Philip J. Venables?—?who as chief information risk officer leads the firm’s programs on information security?—?delivered a Highlands Forum presentation in 2008 at what was called an ‘Enrichment Session on Deterrence.’ Cooper’s chapter draws on Venables’ presentation at Highlands “with permission.” In 2010, Venables participated with his then boss Friedman at an Aspen Institute meeting on the world economy. For the last few years, Venables has also sat on various NSA cybersecurity award review boards.\\n\\nIn sum, the investment firm responsible for creating the billion dollar fortunes of the tech sensations of the 21st century, from Google to Facebook, is intimately linked to the US military intelligence community; with Venables, Lee and Friedman either directly connected to the Pentagon Highlands Forum, or to senior members of the Forum.\\n\\nFighting terror with terror\\n\\nThe convergence of these powerful financial and military interests around the Highlands Forum, through George Lee’s sponsorship of the Forum’s new partner, the MIIS Cysec initiative, is revealing in itself.\\n\\nMIIS Cysec’s director, Dr, Itamara Lochard, has long been embedded in Highlands. She regularly “presents current research on non-state groups, governance, technology and conflict to the US Office of the Secretary of Defense Highlands Forum,” according to her Tufts University bio. She also, “regularly advises US combatant commanders” and specializes in studying the use of information technology by “violent and non-violent sub-state groups.”\\n\\nDr Itamara Lochard is a senior Highlands Forum member and Pentagon information operations expert. She directs the MIIS CyberSec initiative that now supports the Pentagon Highlands Forum with funding from Goldman Sachs partner George Lee, who led the valuations of Facebook and Google.\\n\\nDr Lochard maintains a comprehensive database of 1,700 non-state groups including “insurgents, militias, terrorists, complex criminal organizations, organized gangs, malicious cyber actors and strategic non-violent actors,” to analyze their “organizational patterns, areas of cooperation, strategies and tactics.” Notice, here, the mention of “strategic non-violent actors”?—?which perhaps covers NGOs and other groups or organizations engaged in social political activity or campaigning, judging by the focus of other DoD research programs.\\n\\nAs of 2008, Lochard has been an adjunct professor at the US Joint Special Operations University where she teaches a top secret advanced course in ‘Irregular Warfare’ that she designed for senior US special forces officers. She has previously taught courses on ‘Internal War’ for senior “political-military officers” of various Gulf regimes.\\n\\nHer views thus disclose much about what the Highlands Forum has been advocating all these years. In 2004, Lochard was co-author of a study for the US Air Force’s Institute for National Security Studies on US strategy toward ‘non-state armed groups.’ The study on the one hand argued that non-state armed groups should be urgently recognized as a ‘tier one security priority,’ and on the other that the proliferation of armed groups “provide strategic opportunities that can be exploited to help achieve policy goals. There have and will be instances where the United States may find collaborating with armed group is in its strategic interests.” But “sophisticated tools” must be developed to differentiate between different groups and understand their dynamics, to determine which groups should be countered, and which could be exploited for US interests. “Armed group profiles can likewise be employed to identify ways in which the United States may assist certain armed groups whose success will be advantageous to US foreign policy objectives.”\\n\\nIn 2008, Wikileaks published a leaked restricted US Army Special Operations field manual, which demonstrated that the sort of thinking advocated by the likes of Highlands expert Lochard had been explicitly adopted by US special forces.\\n\\nLochard’s work thus demonstrates that the Highlands Forum sat at the intersection of advanced Pentagon strategy on surveillance, covert operations and irregular warfare: mobilizing mass surveillance to develop detailed information on violent and non-violent groups perceived as potentially threatening to US interests, or offering opportunities for exploitation, thus feeding directly into US covert operations.\\n\\nThat, ultimately, is why the CIA, the NSA, the Pentagon, spawned Google. So they could run their secret dirty wars with even greater efficiency than ever before.',\n",

       " ('Authored by Patrick Armstrong via The Strategic Culture Foundation,\\n\\nSometimes things can be made more complicated than they really are.\\n\\nAnd such is the case with the story that the Russian government hacked the Democratic National Committee so as to help Trump become president.\\n\\nIn July 2016 Wikileaks released a number of documents showing that the nomination of Hillary Clinton as the Democratic candidate for president had been rigged. A month earlier the DNC had announced it had been \"hacked\" and the cybersecurity company it hired announced that the Russians had done it – one of the reasons they gave was that the hackers had helpfully left the name of the Polish founder of the Soviet security forces as a clue.\\n\\nSince then, this story has been broadly accepted and it has spun on and on for eighteen months. But it doesn\\'t really make any sense.\\n\\nLet us pretend that Moscow wanted Trump to win. Let us further pretend that Moscow thought that there was a chance that he could win despite the fact that almost all news outlets, pollsters and pundits were completely confident that he could not. And let us pretend that Moscow thought that, with its thumb on the scale, Trump could make it. And, the fourth if, let us pretend that Moscow decided to put its thumb on the scale.\\n\\nHow to do it? Let us pretend (number five) that the strategy was to try and discredit Clinton. Let us further assume (this assumption is the one that\\'s probably true) that Moscow has very good electronic intelligence capacities. So, we imagine the scene in headquarters as they look for an approach; they quickly find one that is very good, a second that is pretty good and a third area that is worth digging around in.\\n\\nThe Russians would know all about the Uranium One matter where, as even the Clinton-friendly NYT admitted, \"a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation\". It would be very easy for them to package this as a case of Secretary of State Clinton selling US policy for personal profit. Russian intelligence organisations would have a great deal of true information and would find it easy to manufacture material to fill in any gaps in the story. Presented as a case of corruption and near treason, the story could have done a great deal of damage to her. And, given that it had happened six years earlier, all the details would have been known and ready to be used. It would have been a very powerful attack that even the complaint media would have had difficulty ignoring.\\n\\nWe know, and it\\'s very likely that the Russians did too, that she ran a private e-mail server on which there were thousands and thousands of official communications. The server was very insecure and we can assume that Russia\\'s signals intelligence (and everyone else\\'s, for that matter) had penetrated it. Think of all the real material from that source that could be revealed or twisted to make a scandal. That would make quite a campaign. Further, it is a reasonable assumption that Russian intelligence would have some of the thousands of e-mails that were \"bleached\". There would be enough material for a months-long campaign of leaks.\\n\\nFinally, Hillary Clinton has been in public life for many years and there would have been ample opportunities, and, many would say, ample material in her scandal-plagued career, for the construction of many campaigns to weaken her appeal.\\n\\nSo, a preliminary look would suggest that there were several angles of attack of which Uranium One would be the easiest and most effective.\\n\\nBut, failing that, or as a supplement to that, there was plenty of embarrassing and incriminating material in her illicit private server.\\n\\nNow we have to pretend (number six), contrary to the universal practice of security organs in all times and places, that the (always assumed in the story to be implacably hostile) Russians would decide to forgo the chance of compromising a future POTUS in favour of a harebrained scheme to get another elected.\\n\\nBut we\\'re supposed to believe that they did. The Russians, the story goes, with all this potential material, with a solid hit with Uranium One, decide instead to expose the finagling inside the Democratic Party structure. And to expose it too late to make any difference. As I said at the beginning, sometimes things are easier to understand when you, as it were, turn them upside down.\\n\\nIn the middle of June 2016 the DNC admits that its documents have been obtained – a \"hack\" they insist – and almost immediately, \"Guccifer 2.0\" pops up to claim responsibility and the DNC\\'s experts (Crowdstrike) claim Russia was behind it. A month passes before Wikileaks releases the first batch of DNC documents showing the extent of the manipulation of the process by Clinton – who had, according to most counts – already secured the nomination about two weeks before. A couple of days before the release, Trump gets the Republican nomination and a couple of days after that Clinton easily wins the Democratic nomination by a thousand-vote majority.\\n\\nSo, the first thing that should have occurred to the observer (but didn\\'t) was, if the Russians had had this incriminating evidence that the Democratic Party nomination had been fixed in Clinton\\'s favour, wouldn\\'t it have been more useful to put it out at a time when Sanders who was, after all, the swindled one, might have been able to do something about it? Instead those supposedly clever Russian state hackers dropped the news out at a time when it made very little difference. No difference in fact: Clinton got the nomination and there was no comeback from Sanders\\' people.\\n\\nSo, the \"Russian hackers\" made their arrow, shot it, hit the target and... no one cared. The people who devoutly believe in the Russian hacking story now have to explain (but don\\'t) why the Russian state, apparently so determined to bring Clinton down, didn\\'t immediately hit her with the Uranium One documents and anything else they had that could feed the flames of scandal.\\n\\nBut, as we all know, they didn\\'t. While long rumoured, and even briefly reported on, we only learned of Uranium One in a big way in October 2017 and the fact that her server contained Special Access material (the very highest classified secrets) was confirmed authoritatively only in November 2017. If the Russian had really had this sort of information and the hostility to Clinton that we\\'re incessantly told that they had, two years earlier would have been the time.\\n\\nSo, on the one hand we are supposed to believe that the Russian government is so clever that it can hack anything, has innumerable social media trolls that influence elections and referendums around the world (\"control the American mind\"), drives a \"fake news\" campaign at a fraction of the cost but with far greater effectiveness than the massed legions of the Western media, is a threat to practically everything we hold sacred... but is too stupid to get it right. Possessing great and powerful secrets and a stunningly powerful machine to spread them, it chooses to fire a damp squib too late to make any difference and passes up the chance to have a compromised US president for it to control.\\n\\nIn other words, it\\'s nonsense: we don\\'t really need the forensics of VIPS; we don\\'t need to argue with people who say it\\'s fake news about Seth Rich, or that Assange is a Putinbot, or carefully ignore Murray. Those efforts are useful enough but they\\'re not necessary. In any case, the Russia story is a Gish gallop and a whole academy of wise men and women couldn\\'t keep up with the latest. (Robert Parry bravely attempts to list the most prominent ones from the Vermont power facility, through all 17 agencies to 14th not 4th.)\\n\\nJust common sense will do it: if the Russians had wanted to bring Hillary Clinton down, they had far more powerful charges which they could have detonated much earlier. It is not plausible that all they had was the rigging evidence and that they then deployed it too late to have an effect.\\n\\nOr, maybe they\\'re not so all-competent in which case all the other stuff we\\'ve had shoved down our throats for months about \"Russian information warfare\" is even bigger nonsense.',\n",

       " ('Authored by Paul Craig Roberts,\\n\\nOnce upon a time the leftwing of the political spectrum was committed to the advancement of the working class and its protection from political and economic abuse by the owners of the means of production. Consequently, the leftwing was politically potent and reached a pinnacle of power when Henry Wallace was selected by Franklin D. Roosevelt as his third term vice president. Despite his wealth from the company he founded, Wallace stood for the farmer and the working class.\\n\\nThe Democratic Party power brokers refused to accept Wallace as the vice president candidate until FDR told them he otherwise would decline the presidential nomination.\\n\\nWallace was Roosevelt’s and the Democratic voters’ choice for vice president in Roosevelt’s fourth term. But Wallace’s progressive views had alienated the party bosses, Wall Street bankers, anti-union businesses, and America’s British and French allies with his support for labor unions, women, minorities, and victims of colonialism. When he called for the emancipation of colonial subjects and for working with the Soviet Union in the cause of peace and working class justice, he sealed his fate. Despite a Gallup Poll released during the Democratic national convention in July 1944 showing that Wallace was the favorite with 65% of the vote and Roosevelt’s announcement that if he were a delegate, he would choose Wallace, the party bosses chose Harry Truman who was preferred by only 2% of Democratic voters.\\n\\nThis was a turning point in US politics and world history. If the people had prevailed over the corrupt Democratic party bosses, Wallace instead of Truman would have become the first postwar US president. Most likely, there would have been no Cold War, no Korean War, no Vietnam War, no NATO, and no decades of mutual distrust between the US and Russia that today threatens life on earth.\\n\\nMoreover, in place of today’s highly skewed income and wealth distribution toward the very rich fraction of one percent, there would be an equitable distribution that would support a strong consumer market instead of declining real incomes and debt expansion that threatens economic growth, business profits, employment, and high equity values.\\n\\nOliver Stone and Peter Kuznick in their best seller, The Untold History of the United States, describe the Clinton-style Democratic Party corruption that was used to block Wallace as the vice presidential candidate:\\n\\n“Party insiders made sure they had an iron grip on the convention. Yet the rank-and-file Democrats would not go quietly, staging a rebellion on the convention floor. The groundswell of support for Wallace among the delegates and attendees was so great that despite the bosses’ stranglehold over the proceedings and strong-arm tactics, Wallace’s supporters almost carried the day as an uproarious demonstration for Wallace broke out on the convention floor. In the midst of the demonstration, Florida Senator Claude Pepper realized that if he got Wallace’s name into nomination that night, Wallace would sweep the convention. Pepper fought his way through the crowd to get within five feet of the microphone when the nearly hysterical Mayor Kelly, purporting that there was a fire hazard, got the Chairman, Senator Samuel Jackson, to adjourn the proceedings. Had Pepper made it five more feet and nominated Wallace before the bosses forced adjournment against the will of the delegates, Wallace would have become president in 1945 and the course of history would have been dramatically altered.”\\n\\nThe next day Senator Jackson apologized to Senator Pepper:\\n\\n“I had strict instructions from Hannegan not to let the convention nominate the vice president last night. So I had to adjourn the convention in your face.”\\n\\nThus was the power of interest groups to prevail over democracy 73 years ago when there was still a press that would on occasion speak for the people. Dave Kranzler and Brett Arends describe the power of the interests and the degeneration of the media today:\\n\\n“It’s been my view since circa 2003 that [the oligarchs] would hold up the system with printed money and credit creation until every last crumb of middle class wealth was swept off the table and into the pockets of those in position to do the sweeping. “Obama delivered nothing on his original campaign promises. He was going to “reform” Wall Street. But the concept of Too Big To Fail was legislated under Obama, and Wall Street indictments/prosecutions fell precipitously from the previous Administration. “Obama left office and entered into a world of high six-figure Wall Street-sponsored speaking engagements and to live in a $10 million estate in Hawaii paid for by the Chicago elite (Pritzkers etc). Now Obama will be paid off $10’s of millions for his role in aiding and abetting the transfer of trillions from the middle class to the elitists. Look at Bill and Hillary – need I say more? Trump has reversed course on his campaign promises twice as quickly as Obama. Almost overnight after his inauguration, Trump became a war-mongering hand-puppet for the Deep State’s ‘Swamp’ creatures. “The media has been willingly complicit in this big charade. Much to my complete shock, Brett Arends has published a commentary on Marketwatch which, from an insider, warns about the media: ‘Do you want to know what kind of person makes the best reporter? I’ll tell you. A borderline sociopath. Someone smart, inquisitive, stubborn, disorganized, chaotic, and in a perpetual state of simmering rage at the failings of the world. Once upon a time you saw people like this in every newsroom in the country. They often had chaotic personal lives and they died early of cirrhosis or a heart attack. But they were tough, angry SOBs and they produced great stories. ‘Do you want to know what kind of people get promoted and succeed in the modern news organization? Social climbers. Networkers. People who are gregarious, who “buy in” to the dominant consensus, who go along to get along and don’t ask too many really awkward questions. They are flexible, well-organized, and happy with life. And it shows.’ “This is why so many reporters are happy to report that U.S. corporations are in great financial shape, even though they also have surging debts, or that a ‘diversified portfolio’ of stocks and bonds will protect you in all circumstances, even though this is not the case, or that defense budgets are being slashed, when they aren’t, or that the U.S. economy has massively outperformed rivals such as Japan, when on key metrics it hasn’t, or that companies must pay CEOs gazillions of dollars to secure the top ‘talent’ when they don’t need to do any such thing and such pay is just plunder.”\\n\\nThe American leftwing has been transmogrified. The left, which formerly stood for “peace and bread,” today stands for Identity Politics and war. The working class has been redefined as “the Trump deplorables” and splintered into separate “victim groups”—women, racial minorities, homosexuals, transgendered. The oppressors are no longer oligarchs who own the means of production. The oppressor is the sexist, misogynist, homophobic, heterosexual, fascist, white supremacist male working class.\\n\\nThe rise of Identity Politics has brought with it politically controlled speech. Primarily white people, especially heterosexual white males, are subject to this control. The limits on their free speech are growing ever more severe, and no one has to be concerned about white heterosexual males being offended by offensive or threatening speech. White males can be called anything and they are.\\n\\nBy splintering the working class into victim groups, Identity Politics has made opposition to war and income inequality impossible. In place of unity, Identity Politics has dismembered the working class and directed its energies into internal disputes. We now have fistfights in London’s Hyde Park between radical feminists and transgendered activists.\\n\\nDiana Johnstone has shown how Antifa, the violent arm of Identity Politics, has turned the leftwing into a suppressor of free speech and a supporter of war.\\n\\nA splintered society cannot recognize or resist its oppression by a ruling elite.\\n\\nFeminism turns wives and husbands from complements into rivals. Indeed, Sarah Knapton, science editor for the London Telegraph, reports on the rise of “bromance,” strong emotional relationships between heterosexual men. Feminist attacks on men and political correctness have reduced millennial heterosexual males’ relationships with women to sex only. Their emotional commitments are to their male friends. This doesn’t seem like a victory for women.\\n\\nThe cultivated hyper-sensitivity of political correctness, which arises from Identity Politics, is destroying language, history, and free speech. The UK government opposes the term “pregnant woman” because it excludes and offends transgender people.\\n\\nThe British Medical Association has issued guidelines that doctors should not use the word “mother” to refer to a pregnant woman as the term could offend transgender people. Instead, the term “pregnant people” should be used. This has led to more conflict between feminists and the transgendered. Feminists see it as a plot to make “women” unmentionable. British National Health Service doctors are no longer to use the term “expectant mother” because it is “non-inclusive.”\\n\\nIdentity Politics, together with the rising American police state, have just about destroyed the First Amendment. A professor at one of America’s research universities told me that he was dressed down by a dean because he used the word “girls” in class and a woman was offended. Google fired one of its senior software engineers because he wrote a memo that men and women have different traits that make them suitable for different kinds of jobs. This statement of ordinary common sense got the engineer fired for “gender stereotyping.”\\n\\nEconomic commentator Marc Faber was removed from the board of the investment company, Sprott, and banned from CNBC and the Fox Business Network for expressing his views against monument removal and that white Americans have done a better job of building an economy than black Zimbabwe.\\n\\nFree speech is not supposed to be limited to words that give no offense to anyone. What this definition of free speech does is to eliminate all criticism of wrong or criminal activity and all dissent against war, police brutality, and political, social, and economic programs. In other words, political correctness silences a population. Silencing is permitted regardless of whether the “offensive” statement is true or false. Just expressing a truth, as the Google engineer did, can destroy a person’s career. There is no freedom in such a system. As George Orwell said, “If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.”\\n\\nUniversities themselves, traditionally dependent on free speech, are now themselves banning free speech. Controversial speakers likely to offend some “victim group” are simply prevented from speaking at universities. For example, speakers in favor of multiculturalism are welcomed even though the speech might offend those who believe the US is a white Christian society, but a white supremacist, whose speech at the University of Florida could not be blocked, caused the Florida governor to declare a state of emergency.\\n\\nIt seems simple enough that if a person doesn’t want to be offended by a speaker, don’t go to the speech . On the other hand, if a person wants to learn what the opposition is up to, why miss the chance? In the end, political correctness is about regulating what can be said and controlling explanations, not about protecting the hyper-sensitive from hurtful words.\\n\\nWhat Identity Politics and political correctness are doing is demonizing white people and heterosexual males. Only white people are racists. Only heterosexual males - essentially white gentile ones except for Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein - commit sexual violence. As David Rosen writes in CounterPunch, “Male sexual violence: as American as cherry pie.”\\n\\nRosen defines sexual abuse as “a form of sexual terror, an all-American male sport” that is “as old as the country.” In other words, all or most American males practice sexual terror on women. We have reached the point where a wife who gets angry at her husband can accuse him of rape and have him imprisoned, a far departure from the days when husband and wife were legally regarded as one and neither could testify against the other. When the most intimate personal relationship is subject to outside intervention, how does marriage prosper?\\n\\nIt doesn’t. According to the American Psychological Association, “about 40 to 50 percent of married couples in the United States divorce. The divorce rate for subsequent marriages is even higher.”\\n\\nIf husband and wife, mother and father, can’t stay together, how does society stay together?\\n\\nHow does society stay together when Identity Politics teaches hate and inflames social divisiveness?\\n\\nHow does society stay together when thugs claiming to be offended offend others by destroying historical monuments that are associated with the memory or identity of others?\\n\\nHow does society stay together when its history is erased, its schools, streets, and public buildings are renamed?\\n\\nAs George Orwell said, “The most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history.” The next monuments to be removed are those of the Founding Fathers, racists all who adopted a Constitution that permitted slavery, an inherited institution that they had no power to reform.\\n\\nIn the United States history is being rewritten and language corrupted in order to foster hatred of white “oppressors,” especially white heterosexual males.\\n\\nLittle wonder Russia responds diplomatically to Washington’s aggression. No need to reply in kind when an enemy is destroying itself.',\n",

       " (\"Authored by Pepe Escobar via The Asia Times,\\n\\nSaudi women being allowed to drive is a smokescreen – Salafi-jihadism is alive and well inside the Kingdom. What's more, another coup may be along shortly...\\n\\nSuddenly, the ideological matrix of all strands of Salafi-jihadism is being hailed by the West as a model of progress – because Saudi women will finally be allowed to drive. Only next year. Only some women. And still subject to many restrictions.\\n\\nWhat’s certain is that the timing of the announcement – which comes after years of liberal American pressure – was calculated with precision, arriving only a few days before House of Saud capo King Salman drops in for a chat at Trump’s White House. The soft power move was coordinated by the 32-year-old Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, a.k.a. MBS, the Destroyer of Yemen; the king merely added his signature.\\n\\nThe diversionary tactic masks serious trouble in the court. A Gulf business source with intimate knowledge of the House of Saud, having held a number of personal meetings with members, told Asia Times that “the Fahd, Nayef, and Abdullah families, the descendants of King Abdulaziz al Saud and his wife Hassa bin Ahmed al-Sudairi, are forming an alliance against the ascendancy to the Kingship of the Crown Prince.”\\n\\nNo wonder, considering that the ousted Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef – highly regarded in the Beltway, especially Langley – is under house arrest. His massive web of agents at the Interior Ministry has largely been “relieved of their authority”. The new Interior Minister is Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Nayef, 34, the eldest son of the governor of the country’s largely Shi’ite Eastern Province, where all the oil is. Curiously, the father is now reporting to his son. MBS is surrounded by inexperienced thirty-something princes, and alienating just about everyone else.\\n\\nFormer King Abdulaziz set up his Saudi succession based on the seniority of his sons; in theory, if each one lived to the same age all would have a shot at the throne, thus avoiding the bloodletting historically common in Arabian clans over lines of succession.\\n\\nNow, says the source, “a bloodbath is predicted to be imminent.” Especially because “the CIA is outraged that the compromise worked out in April, 2014 has been abrogated wherein the greatest anti-terrorist factor in the Middle East, Mohammed bin Nayef, was arrested.” That may prompt “vigorous action taken against MBS possibly in early October.” And it might even coincide with the Salman-Trump get together.\\n\\nISIS playing by the (Saudi) book\\n\\nAsia Times’ Gulf business source stresses how “the Saudi economy is under extreme strain based on their oil price war against Russia, and they are behind their bills in paying just about all their contractors. That could lead to the bankruptcy of some of the major enterprises in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Arabia of MBS features the Crown Prince buying a US$600 million yacht and his father spending US$100 million on his summer vacation, highlighted on the front pages of the New York Times while the Kingdom strangles under their leadership.”\\n\\nMBS’s pet project, the spun-to-death Vision 2030, in theory aims to diversify from mere oil profits and dependency on the US to a more modern economy (and a more independent foreign policy).\\n\\nThat’s completely misguided, according to the source, because “the problem in Saudi Arabia is that their companies cannot function with their local population and [are] reliant on expatriates for about 70% or more of their staff. Aramco cannot run without expatriates. Therefore, selling 5% of Aramco to diversify does not solve the problem. If he wants a more productive society, and less handouts and meaningless government jobs, he has to first train and employ his own people.”\\n\\nThe similarly lauded Aramco IPO, arguably the largest share sale in history and originally scheduled for next year, has once again been postponed – “possibly” to the second half of 2019, according to officials in Riyadh. And still no one knows where shares will be sold; the NYSE is far from a done deal.\\n\\nIn parallel, MBS’s war on Yemen, and the Saudi drive for regime change in Syria and to reshape the Greater Middle East, have turned out to be spectacular disasters. Egypt and Pakistan have refused to send troops to Yemen, where relentless Saudi air bombing – with US and UK weapons – has accelerated malnutrition, famine and cholera, and configured a massive humanitarian crisis.\\n\\nThe Islamic State project was conceived as the ideal tool to force Iraq to implode. It’s now public domain that the organization’s funding came mostly from Saudi Arabia. Even the former imam of Mecca has publicly admitted ISIS’ leadership “draw their ideas from what is written in our own books, our own principles.”\\n\\nWhich brings us to the ultimate Saudi contradiction. Salafi-jihadism is more than alive inside the Kingdom even as MBS tries to spin a (fake) liberal trend (the “baby you can drive my car” stunt). The problem is Riyadh congenitally cannot deliver on any liberal promise; the only legitimacy for the House of Saud lies in those religious “books” and “principles.”\\n\\nIn Syria, besides the fact that an absolute majority of the country’s population does not wish to live in a Takfiristan, Saudi Arabia supported ISIS while Qatar supported al-Qaeda (Jabhat al-Nusra). That ended up in a crossfire bloodbath, with all those non-existent US-supported “moderate rebels” reduced to road kill.\\n\\nAnd then there’s the economic blockade against Qatar – another brilliant MBS plot. That has only served to improve Doha’s relations with both Ankara and Tehran. Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani was not regime-changed, whether or not Trump really dissuaded Riyadh and Abu Dhabi from taking “military action.” There was no economic strangulation: Total, for instance, is about to invest US$2 billion to expand production of Qatari natural gas. And Qatar, via its sovereign fund, counterpunched with the ultimate soft power move – it bought global footballing brand Neymar for PSG, and the “blockade” sank without a trace.\\n\\n“Robbing their people blind”\\n\\nIn Enemy of the State, the latest Mitch Rapp thriller written by Kyle Mills, President Alexander, sitting at the White House, blurts, “the Middle East is imploding because those Saudi sons of bitches have been pumping up religious fundamentalism to hide the fact that they’re robbing their people blind.” That’s a fair assessment.\\n\\nNo dissent whatsoever is allowed in Saudi Arabia. Even the economic analyst Isam Az-Zamil, very close to the top, has been arrested during the current repression campaign. So opposition to MBS does not come only from the royal family or some top clerics – although the official spin rules that only those supporting Muslim Brotherhood, Turkey, Iran and Qatari “terrorism” are being targeted.\\n\\nIn terms of what Washington wants, the CIA is not fond of MBS, to say the least. They want “their” man Nayef back. As for the Trump administration, rumors swirl it is “desperate for Saudi money, especially infrastructure investments in the Rust Belt.”\\n\\nIt will be immensely enlightening to compare what Trump gets from Salman with what Putin gets from Salman: the ailing King will visit Moscow in late October. Rosneft is interested in buying shares of Aramco when the IPO takes place. Riyadh and Moscow are considering an OPEC deal extension as well as an OPEC-non-OPEC cooperation platform incorporating the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF).\\n\\nRiyadh has read the writing on the new wall: Moscow’s rising political / strategic capital all across the board, from Iran, Syria and Qatar to Turkey and Yemen.\\n\\nThat does not sit well with the US deep state.\\n\\nEven if Trump gets some Rust Belt deals, the burning question is whether the CIA and its friends can live with MBS on the House of Saud throne.\",\n",

       " (\"Authored by Rachel Stoltzfoos via The Federalist,\\n\\nEmployees were allowed to award those who spoke out against Damore's memo 'peer bonuses' monitored by the 'Google Recognition Team'...\\n\\nThe lawsuit James Damore filed against Google on Monday provides a fascinating glimpse into the way the company and many of its employees see the workplace in terms of a demographic hierarchy, and what happens to those who diverge from the consensus view.\\n\\nDetails from diversity training sessions, accounts of alleged reverse discrimination, and screenshots of internal communications on company forums and message boards in the lawsuit cast the company culture as extremely hostile to employees with unpopular opinions, especially heterosexuals, men, white people, and those who hold conservative views.\\n\\nDamore and another former Google employee, David Gudeman, allege the company discriminates against white male conservatives, and maintains illegal diversity quotas for hiring managers. Damore was fired last year after an internal memo he wrote positing that men and women have biological differences that affect their work preferences and abilities was leaked and went viral.\\n\\nIn screenshots laid out in the lawsuit, “Googlers” as they call themselves, talk openly of blacklisting and purging the company of employees whose views or identities are deemed outside the bounds. Employees were allowed to award those who spoke out against Damore’s memo “peer bonuses” — a company kudos of sorts monitored by the “Google Recognition Team.”\\n\\n“We want to be inclusive of people not ideas” one employee identified as Alon Altman wrote in a message included in the lawsuit. Damore says that sentiment was backed up at an Inclusion and Diversity Summit he attended in June, when he was told by Google employees the company does not value “viewpoint diversity,” but actively strives for “demographic diversity.”\\n\\nThe lawsuit succeeds in suggesting a sharply divisive worldview pervades Google, in which those deemed worthy of tolerating (women, minorities, transgenders, etc.) are to be protected and agreed with at all costs — the recipients of unbridled compassion and understanding — while those who fall outside the bounds are to be ruthlessly disowned and expelled.\\n\\nHere are 19 of the most notable and bizarre snapshots of corporate culture laid out in the lawsuit.\\n\\n1. ‘Living as a Plural Being’\\n\\nIn a section claiming Google tries to “stifle” conservative parenting styles, the suit reads: “Google furnishes a large number of internal mailing lists catering to employees with alternative lifestyles, including furries, polygamy, transgenderism, and plurality, for the purpose of discussing sexual topics. The only lifestyle that seems to not be openly discussed on Google’s internal forums is traditional heterosexual monogamy.”\\n\\nA footnote next to the word “plurality” adds: “For instance, an employee who sexually identifies as ‘a yellow-scaled wingless dragonkin’ and ‘an expansive ornate building’ presented a talk entitled ‘Living as a Plural Being’ at an internal company event.”\\n\\nThe suit also includes a screenshot of the presentation on “living as a plural being” when the presenter is discussing how to address coworkers with multiple identities. Examples of “not okay” etiquette listed include “addressing any one headmate in particular; we’re all listening!”\\n\\n2. ‘Don’t hire white men’\\n\\nA few of the messages show Google employees proposing hiring practices that exclude certain groups of men, or putting women in charge of hiring for a year to ensure diversity quotas are met. One employee wrote: “Alternate proposal: moratorium on hiring white cis heterosexual abled men who aren’t abuse survivors.”\\n\\n3. ‘Bias busting’\\n\\nDamore recounts attending “voluntary” diversity training because Google employees stressed attendance as necessary if he were to advance in the company. “At the in-person training, entitled ‘Bias Busting,’ Google discussed how biases against women exist in the workplace, and how ‘white male privilege’ exists in the workplace,” the suit reads. “The training was run by the ‘Unbiasing Group’ at Google.\\n\\n4. ‘I will keep hounding you until one of us fired’\\n\\nAfter a coworker leaked his memo to the public, Google’s human resources instructed Damore to work remotely for a while to let emotions cool, after he forwarded them a particularly angry email from another employee. “You’re a misogynist and a terrible person,” read a late-night email from Alex Hidalgo, a Google engineer. “I will keep hounding you until one of us is fired. Fuck you.”\\n\\n5. ‘The Derail document’\\n\\nThe suit claims Gudeman was fired in part because he took issue with the merits of a “derail document” written by Google manager Kim Burchett. “The thesis of this document is that on this one particular set of topics, the left-wing political frame of systematic bias, must always dominate, and the receiver must accept that frame, and its associated worldview, in their response,” the suit claims. It does not provide the actual document.\\n\\nIn his response, Gudeman said “the point of this document is to disallow any defense at all that a man might make when some woman complains about bias. There is no defense. The woman is always right. The man has no alternative but to submit to her superior moral position. We have a word for that attitude, it’s called ‘sexism.'”\\n\\nHe says the criticism was widely derided and deemed “un-Googley.”\\n\\n6. ‘You did something so amazing that Matthew Sachs awarded you a Peer Bonus’\\n\\nThe suit includes a screenshot of one of the emailed “peer bonuses” awarded to those who opposed Damore.\\n\\n“Congratulations, Simone Wu!” the email begins. “You did something so amazing that Matthew Sachs awarded you a Peer Bonus. Here’s what Matthew Sachs had to say: Simone has been doing a fantastic job speaking up for Googley values and promoting [diversity and inclusion] in the wretched hive of scum and villainy that is [Damore’s memo] … Visit your award history page to see your certificate to print and proudly hang on your cube, wall, fridge, robot etc.”\\n\\n7. ‘Discourage them all throughout the industry’\\n\\n“If we really care about diversity in tech, we don’t just need to chase serial offenders out of Google, we need to discourage them all throughout the industry,” a lengthy internal post on Damore read. “We should be willing to give a wink and a nod to other Silicon Valley employers over terminable offenses, not send the worst parts of tech packing with a smile …”\\n\\n8. ‘I will hurt you’\\n\\nDamore’s memo prompted another employee to post this quote: “I’m a queer-ass nonbinary trans person that is fucking sick and tired of being told to open a dialogue with people who want me dead. We are at a point where the dialogue we need to be having with these people is ‘if you keep talking about this shit, i will hurt you.”\\n\\n9. ‘Relies on crowdsourced harassment’\\n\\nGoogle encourages employees to enforce unwritten norms by harassing and ostracizing those who break them, according to the suit, and by allowing employees to create “blocklists” on their communications systems. “[Google] relies on crowdsourced harassment and ‘pecking’ to enforce social norms (including politics) that it feels it cannot write directly into its policies,” the suit states.\\n\\n10. ‘I…apologized for whitesplaining’\\n\\nIn a message from July 2017, a repentant Google employee publicly realized he was “whitesplaining” black history. “I (a white Googler), in an attempt to build a rapport with a Black Noogler and demonstrate my lack of ignorance of Black History, ended up whitesplaining Black History to him…thereby demonstrating my ignorance of Black History in the process. A few minutes later, feeling like a complete idiot, I went back to him and apologized for whitesplaining.”\\n\\nHis comment was lauded by another Googler.\\n\\n11. ‘You’re being blacklisted…at companies outside Google’\\n\\nGoogle manager Adam Fletcher wrote in 2015 he would never hire conservatives he deemed hold hostile views. “I will never, ever hire/transfer you onto my team,” he wrote. “Ever. I don’t care if you are perfect fit or technically excellent or whatever. I will actively not work with you, even to the point where your team or product is impacted by this decision. I’ll communicate why to your manager if it comes up.”\\n\\n“You’re being blacklisted by people at companies outside of Google,” he added. “You might not have been aware of this, but people know, people talk. There are always social consequences.”\\n\\n12. Conservative author triggers ‘silent alarm’ over lunch with employee\\n\\nConservative blogger Curtis Yarvin, who advised Steve Bannon and other members of the Trump administration, triggered an alarm when he visited the Google campus to lunch with an employee. Security escorted him off the premises. The suit alleges other conservatives are on that list, including Alex Jones and Theodore Beale.\\n\\n13. ‘Should inclusion on the list require something resembling a trial?’\\n\\nBurchett once proposed creating a list she would personally manage of “people who make diversity difficult,” to include employees who did things like make statements “unsupportive of diversity.” She suggested the list could serve as a punishment that could incentivize “better” behavior among the offenders listed.\\n\\n“Things I’m still pondering: should inclusion on the list require something resembling a trial? should people be removed after some period of time if they start behaving better?”\\n\\n14. ‘Throw away that bad apple with no regrets’\\n\\nThe suit says Google manager Jay Gengelbach discussed blacklisting an intern whose views proved intransigent, despite the efforts of Google employees to bring him around to their views. “I was there at the lunch were said intern said the things he did,” Googler Matthew Seidl replied on the thread. “A number of people there did try to esquire as to what he was basing his belief on and give counter examples. They didn’t really take.”\\n\\nAnother Googler chimed in, “Throw that bad apple away with no regrets.”\\n\\n15. ‘I won’t say violence has no place’\\n\\nIn one thread, employees discussed at length whether Trump’s win meant it’s time for a violent revolution. “How do people cope with this?” one employee wrote. “I’ve never been part of a military or war effort before. … I don’t know how useful I’ll be.”\\n\\nAnother advised: “Get in touch with your friendly local antifa. … I won’t say violence has no place, but if you are going to be doing anything risky, I can’t overemphasize the important of networking with people who’ve been thinking about scenarios like the one we’re in for years, and building relationships with them. We are only powerful if we organize.”\\n\\n“This list is not truly anonymous,” another cautioned.\\n\\n16. ‘If you don’t want to get punched …’\\n\\nOne employee explained what to believe if you don’t want to get physically assaulted. “There is literally only one reason an antifascist would be violent towards you. You are a fascist. … If you don’t want to get punched by an antifascist, it’s simple: don’t go to white supremacist rallies and don’t own white power symbols.”\\n\\n17. ‘How to (Properly) Punch a Nazi’\\n\\nTwo more bits on punching Nazis. In the first, an employee explains why peaceful measures aren’t enough when facing people with certain views. “How do you let people know you don’t take their ideas seriously? … No-platforming fascists does scale. So does punching one on camera.” And a cartoon sent around depicts a Nazi-punching strategy.\\n\\n18. ‘Psychotic break from reality’\\n\\nThose who oppose certain liberal orthodoxy must be either “deeply deceived” or have had “some sort of psychotic break from reality,” another employee wrote, adding: “What you think of as information is nonsense.”\\n\\n19. ‘This is where my tolerance ends, with intolerance’\\n\\n“You can’t support Donald Trump without also supporting his racism, misogyny, homophobia, and transphobia,” a Googler wrote in a lengthy communication on Trump supporters. “Or even worse, if you vote for Donald Trump because of his economic policy or because you feel the other party is corrupt, then what you’re saying is that economics is more important than the safety of your peers. This is where my tolerance ends: with intolerance.”\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nGoogle briefly responded to Damore’s lawsuit Monday in a statement reported by The Verge. “We look forward to defending against Mr. Damore’s lawsuit in court,” a spokesperson said.\",\n",

       " ('Authored by Robert Bruner, op-ed via TheHill.com,\\n\\nTen years ago this month, a recession began in the U.S. that would metastasize into a full-fledged financial crisis. A decade is plenty of time to reflect on what we have learned, what we have fixed, and what remains to be done. High on the agenda should be the utter unpreparedness for what came along.\\n\\nThe memoirs of key decision-makers convey sincere intentions and in some cases, very adroit maneuvering. But common to them all are apologies that today strike one as rather lame.\\n\\n“I was surprised by the sudden crisis,” wrote George W. Bush, “My focus had been kitchen-table economic issues like jobs and inflation. I assumed any major credit troubles would have been flagged by the regulators or rating agencies. … We were blindsided by a financial crisis that had been more than a decade in the making.” Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Fed wrote, “Clearly, many of us at the Fed, including me, underestimated the extent of the housing bubble and the risks it posed.” He cited psychological factors rather than low interest rates, a “tidal wave of foreign money,” and complacency among decision-makers. Timothy Geithner said that, “failures of foresight were primarily failures of imagination … our visions of darkness still weren’t dark enough.” And Henry Paulson explained that “we believed the problem was largely confined to subprime loans. … (Then) the problems were coming far more quickly.”\\n\\nSurprise, underestimation, poor imagination, and disbelief in an adverse outcome are hallmarks of the onset of a financial crisis.\\n\\nMy studies of the 17 major financial crises since the founding of the Republic reveal that over-optimism is an important driver of the bubbles that eventually become busts. As the legendary investor, Sir John Templeton, once said, “The four most dangerous words in investing are ‘This time is different.’” Such was the mindset that real estate prices could only rise (2008), dot-com companies would forever grow and be profitable (2001), or that the Russian government would never default (1998).\\n\\nThese days, the blogosphere chatters about a coming crash and financial crisis, for the obvious reason that conditions feel bubble-ish. We are in the late stage of the third longest economic expansion and second-longest bull market in U.S. history. Stock prices are high: The cyclically-adjusted price-earnings ratio is at the third-highest since 1880. Consumer confidence is buoyant. The personal saving rate, 3.1 percent, is near the all-time low. According to the Fed, financial conditions are looser than average. House prices have broken above their peak at the last housing bubble. A Saudi prince paid $450 million for a painting. And nearly every day, Bitcoin sets record prices.\\n\\nTo be sure, regulatory reforms since 2008 have produced more strongly capitalized banks, tests of resilience to shocks, more inter-agency coordination, and some consumer protections. But like the generals who are prepared to fight the last war, these reforms don’t persuade me that we’ll be ready for the next crisis.\\n\\nHistory shows that crises arise unexpectedly from corners of the economy that fell beyond the conventional radar screen — in such corners, regulations are light or nonexistent, information is scanty, players are relatively unknown, and flows of capital in and out are particularly hot. Human ingenuity will always create such corners of the economy, either to serve new needs or to arbitrage around regulations. To eliminate every scintilla of systemic risk in the financial sector would be extraordinarily costly and would breed an intolerable regime of surveillance.\\n\\nYet I believe that there is one thing that the president and other leaders could do that would help to mitigate the risk of a financial crisis: reinforce a national culture of prudence — this includes the virtues of earning your money before you spend it; saving for a rainy day; investing wisely; honoring your debts; using resources carefully; respecting the property rights of others; and providing for the welfare of family and community. For the president and leaders of Congress to say all of this would evoke gales of laughter in the wake of recent action. Yet the bully pulpit of leadership can set a powerful tone.\\n\\nAt the outset of this tenth anniversary of the Global Financial Crisis, it is well worth remembering that we require not only vigilance from our leaders, but also the ability to articulate enduring values that will assure the sustainability of our society. We have had a culture of prudence in America before: “Use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without” was the simple rhyme of the 1930s upon which America built an episode of extraordinary growth to the 1970s.\\n\\nA culture of prudence is a culture of resilience. Prudence and resilience can trump surprise. Would that the president set this tone.',\n",

There’s supposed to be risk and hard work involved.”\\n\\nBut she wasn’t alone. Legions of amateur investors were piling into the market doing exactly the same thing.\\n\\nEveryone seemed to be flipping condos. And everyone seemed to be making money.\\n\\nIt didn’t add up.\\n\\nI remember one investor explaining to me how he would flip his condo contract to someone else when the building was 30% complete. Then that buyer would flip the contract to another investor when the building was 60% complete. Then another sale when the building was 80% complete, etc.\\n\\n“But who is the person at the end of the line?” I asked. “Someone has to eventually live in all of these condos and be willing to pay the highest price.” “Oh there will ALWAYS be plenty of people who will live here,” he told me.\\n\\nTo these investors it was a foregone conclusion that required zero analysis: there will always be buyers, no matter how high the price gets.\\n\\nOne of the marks of a good investor is learning from his/her mistakes; when an investment performs poorly, a good investor will try to figure out WHY, and incorporate those lessons into future decisions.\\n\\nBut a GREAT investor will learn from his/her successes.\\n\\nThis is rare. Perhaps it’s part of our human nature. When we succeed, we automatically conclude that we’re really smart.\\n\\nWe seldom examine what really happened. Did we get lucky? Were we riding the wave of a giant bubble? Or, perhaps our analysis was spot-on and we nailed it.\\n\\nIt’s hard to say for sure without some serious self-reflection.\\n\\nBut again, it’s in our nature to presume that we’re brilliant.\\n\\nAnd that may be one of the most dangerous things of all… because our infatuation with our own brilliance causes us to do irrational things.\\n\\nInstead of thinking, “Whew, I got really lucky, I’d better take some money off the table before this market crashes,” we think, “I’m so smart… now I’m going to double down and make even more money.”\\n\\nIt’s like gamblers at the craps table– people delude themselves into believing that they’re on a ‘hot streak’ and ‘can’t lose’, so they keep increasing their bets instead of cashing in their chips.\\n\\nEventually the luck runs out… and the money vanishes quickly.\\n\\nI’m telling you all of this because I see the same thing right now in the “ICO” market.\\n\\nIf you haven’t heard of ICOs, it stands for Initial Coin Offering. It’s a combination of venture capital and cryptofinance.\\n\\nTraditionally, startup companies have raised the money they’ve needed from angel investors and VC funds.\\n\\nThese days, companies are raising money by selling digital ‘tokens’ to investors, most of whom typically pay in Bitcoin, Ether, or some other cryptocurrency.\\n\\nTokens often represent shares in the startup company, just in the same way that Apple stock represents shares in Apple.\\n\\nAnd, just like shares of Apple, investors can buy and sell their tokens in the market.\\n\\nThere are countless startup companies now issuing tokens. And, just like the price of the cryptocurrencies themselves, many ICOs have soared in price.\\n\\nThere’s a token issued by Stratis, for example, that is up 101,168% since its ICO last summer. The NXT token is up 672,989%.\\n\\nThose are not type-o’s.\\n\\nThere’s another token that’s actually called “Fuck” which is up 370% in the last 24 hours.\\n\\nThe returns are absurd… especially considering the assets are priced in Ether or Bitcoin, which have also soared to all-time highs.\\n\\nSo on top of a 1,000% return in Bitcoin, ICO investors have also made a 100,000% return in the token.\\n\\nBut I’m hearing exactly the same cackling that I heard from the real estate bubble days more than a decade ago.\\n\\n– It’s soooo easy to make money in ICOs.\\n\\n– It’s a foregone conclusion that the tokens will go up in value.\\n\\nSorry, but it just doesn’t compute.\\n\\nIf the tokens represent ownership in a business, then the only thing that matters is whether or not the underlying business performs well.\\n\\nDoes the company have a compelling long-term strategic plan?\\n\\nMore importantly– are the managers successfully implementing the plan and achieving milestones?\\n\\nIs the company on a path to financial sustainability?\\n\\nNobody seems to be paying attention to these details. They just buy tokens with the expectation that the price will rise.\\n\\nAnd even if a business performs well, it’s ridiculous to think hat a startup company can be worth 100,000% more in a year. Or nearly 700,000% more in a couple of years.\\n\\nTo put these numbers in context, Peter Thiel invested $500,000 in Facebook back in 2004 as the company’s first big investor. In 2012 he sold most of it for $1 billion.\\n\\nThat’s a return of 200,000% in eight years… pretty tame by ICO standards.\\n\\nInvesting isn’t supposed to be easy, especially when speculating in startup companies. There’s supposed to be risk. Serious analysis. And lots of losers.\\n\\nIt’s not to say that there aren’t any good businesses issuing tokens. But it’s pretty clear this trend is a massive bubble.',\n",

       " ('Authored by Steve H. Hanke of the Johns Hopkins University. Follow him on Twitter @Steve_Hanke.\\n\\nIn 2008, Zimbabwe suffered the second most severe case of hyperinflation in modern history. Its annual inflation reached 89.7 sextillion (1023) %. Prices were doubling each day, making the currency almost worthless. The government was forced to scrap the local Zim dollar when Zimbabweans simply refused to use it. Subsequently, the government implemented a multicurrency system based on foreign currencies. But, the U.S. dollar became the coin of the realm. Indeed, even the government accounts became denominated in U.S. dollars in 2009. As a result of this spontaneous dollarization, along with the installation of a new national unity government, the economy rebounded and international trust in Zimbabwe began to be restored.\\n\\nWhen President Mugabe’s party, ZANU-PF, regained control in 2013, economic instability ensued and government spending surged along with public debt (see chart below). With the central bank’s inability to finance the government (read: print Zim dollars), Zimbabwe resorted to monetary trickery and mischief.\\n\\nIn conventional terms, the value of 1 USD is uniform throughout the world; however, Zimbabwe has pulled every trick in the book in an attempt to disprove that truth. For example, what the Zimbabwean government terms a U.S. “dollar” -- a New Zim Dollar (NZD) -- is in reality only worth 50% of a real dollar anywhere else in the world. So, how is this mischief possible?\\n\\nThe answer lies in the government’s creation of the NZD (read: a phony dollar). It has four major components: physical U.S. dollars, bond notes, electronic real time gross settlements (RTGS), and Treasury bills (T-bills). Apart from physical USD, the additional three components have acted to massively increase the money supply in Zimbabwe, broadly measured.\\n\\nT-bills are issued by the government to finance government deficits. These T-bills are unloaded onto local commercial banks that are “coerced” to buy them. It’s no surprise that bankers are anxious about the convertibility of these bonds into real USD at par. Indeed, the bonds maturing from 2019-2020 are already being traded at huge discounts of around 40%. And bankers are not the only ones who are concerned. In April 2017, economist and Zimbabwe Parliamentarian Eddie Cross stated, “This situation is of great concern, the market is discounting TBs by 30 to 40%...There is simply no way the Ministry of Finance or the RBZ [Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe] can redeem this paper or meet interest bills.” In fact, T-bills are currently being redeemed using the RTGS system; however, this policy appears unsustainable.\\n\\nWith commercial banks becoming increasingly fearful, and rightfully so, about the potential for T-bill default, banks have smartly preferred to hold onto physical USD, limiting weekly individual withdraws to only $100. Indeed, cash needed for daily transactions is as scarce as hens’ teeth. Also, with new accounting procedures under the IFRS 9 rules that will take effect on January 1, 2018, T-bills face further potential mark downs. These mark downs just might throw the entire banking system into insolvency (at least in terms of real USD). This would lead to further liquidity shortages and monetary contraction, resulting in a severe economic slump. In an effort to increase liquidity (read: increase money supply) the government has turned to the next two components of the NZD: bond notes and RTGS.\\n\\nElectronic real time gross settlement transfers (RTGS) are the most common unit used in day-to-day transactions for individuals, accounting for approximately 78% of the total value of electronic and plastic transfers in 2016. Like the treasury bills, the RTGS “dollars” trade at a discount of 15-20% to real USD. The RBZ manages the balances in the RTGS system, but offshore RBZ accounts are seemingly no longer backing RTGS with real USD. The RTGS system has become overburdened, with incredibly long transfer times. Indeed, some transfers have even been reported to take up to two weeks. Not surprisingly, RTGS has not solved Zimbabwe’s liquidity problems. If anything, they have aggravated it.\\n\\nThe most recent attempt by the government to increase liquidity (the money supply, measured broadly) was the introduction of bond notes in November 2016 (see accompanying chart). Incidentally, in conversations I had with Dr. Kupukile Mlambo, Deputy Governor of the RBZ, in May of 2016, I strongly opposed the introduction of bond notes, indicating that they were inconsistent with orthodox dollarization and would result in a complete disaster.\\n\\nAlthough bond coins existed on a small scale since December 2014, the introduction of bond notes was significant. These notes were “backed” by a $200m facility from the African Import Export Bank (Afreximbank) -- a bank that some allege is unusually close to the Zimbabwean government. Among other things, it has still failed to publish official documents regarding the bond note facility. The uncertainty surrounding these bond notes has resulted in a black market for dollars, where the bond notes normally trade at discounts ranging from 5-15%. Not surprisingly, banks have attempted to remove these notes from their books, with bank officials reportedly engaging in black market deals for large cash sums at over 20% discounts!\\n\\nAs for what the bonds might eventually be worth, it is prudent to assume that they will be defaulted on. In that case, and taking other African sovereign defaults as a guide, one is left to conclude that the bonds in default would fetch 5-18¢ on the dollar. So, bond notes, which are products of Zimbabwe’s monetary mischief, are in a death spiral that will witness further significant declines in value. In that event, discounts on other elements of the NZD would also realize massive discounts. The NZD would become worthless, and with that, inflation would raise its ugly head.\\n\\nZimbabwe has once again engaged in a fraud on the public, creating a monetary mess and hardship.\\n\\nThis piece was originally published on Forbes.',\n",

       " ('Authored by Tom Luongo via TomLuongo.me,\\n\\nThe biggest open-secret in Hollywood was that Harvey Weinstein was a Grade-A pervert. And his ‘coming out party’ this week is incredibly intriguing. Hollywood is a dirty place.\\n\\nIt’s Chinatown, squared.\\n\\nAnd, at this point it’s what we don’t know that is more interesting than what we’ve heard so far. But, staying focused on Harvey Gropeman, Producer at Large, his position has been to act as one of the main enforcers of the status quo in all of the power centers of the United States.\\n\\nFrom the casting couches of Hollywood to the banks on Wall St. to the grubby think tanks in D.C., this story won’t have all the twists and turns of L.A. Confidential, but it will have the same implications.\\n\\nWeinstein, in effect, was perfectly suited for his role. He is a man of infinite appetites with poor impulse control. A pathetic loser with power over hot, young women desperate for fame.\\n\\nAnd these women made the trade willingly. “Small price to pay, right?” Wrong.\\n\\nLook at the women most opposed to Trump, the Ashley Judds, the Gwynneth Paltrows. They were all used by Weinstein or someone like him. More will come out every day.\\n\\nBen Affleck is next because he couldn’t handle fame and power any better than the rest of them did. He’s also Batman and Disney will not pass up the opportunity to bloody Warner Bros. nose.\\n\\nThe story is perverted by the desperate need of the powerful to maintain their power at all costs. Weinstein’s film companies acted like money laundering operations for the DNC. How many millions did he raise for people like Obama, Hillary, Pelosi, Feinstein?\\n\\nHow many millions were added to the budgets of performer’s salaries to be funneled from Wall St. financiers to those same people?\\n\\nThe whole thing is an internecine nightmare of quid pro quo and the shadiest of finances.\\n\\nAnd Steve Bannon just attacked all of it. In real time.\\n\\nThe Bannonator\\n\\nYes, you heard me. Steve Bannon is the Dr. Evil in this movie. He’s the mastermind behind this. Except that Bannon isn’t the villain (well, to Harvey Weinstein he is) but the protagonist. Think about it for two seconds.\\n\\nWho else has motive, means, opportunity and, most importantly, the will to take on the biggest, most powerful (and pathetic) people in the world.\\n\\nAnd he doesn’t want money. Bannon’s already rich. Remember, as Bannon left the White House he said that there he had influence, but at Breitbart he has power.\\n\\nWe’re seeing the first effects of his deploying that power.\\n\\nGo through it like Jake Gittes or Sam Spade\\n\\nMotive? Bannon, for whatever faults he has, is a patriot. He’s a disciple of Andrew Breitbart who routinely castigated Hollywood to ‘stop raping the children.’ Bannon joined Trump’s campaign and turned the messaging into a pale reflection of his film, “Generation Zero.”\\n\\nBannon understands the cultural and generational imperatives of this moment in time. If you haven’t watched that film then you don’t know who Steve Bannon is.\\n\\nMeans? The man runs Breitbart.\\n\\nOpportunity? Bannon made millions as a producer on Seinfeld. He worked in Hollywood for years. Bannon also saw all sorts of stuff while working for Trump.\\n\\nRemember, I told you on the outside he would be Trump’s Secret Agent, using his newly-found knowledge (cue the Hero Cycle!) from the Underworld of Washington to deploy sump pumps in the swamp.\\n\\nWill? That’s my guess. Spending time in Washington changes everyone. It corrupts the venal and galvanizes the principled. Bannon didn’t want to cut deals to govern. He wasn’t interested in governing the U.S. with Trump, he was interested in blowing up the vile status quo. He runs Breitbart.\\n\\nHow do I know Bannon was behind this? The headlines today are all about how Bannon did some business with Weinstein over a decade ago. A minor company that Bannon ran into the ground. It went bankrupt. Simple guilt by ironic association.\\n\\nHere’s a better question? Who hasn’t worked with Weinstein in Hollywood? This story is simply chum to feed to the loony left’s Facebook feeds. It will alienate even more people from that pillar of thought control.\\n\\nThe left crowed when they thought they’d chased Bannon from the White House. They thought they had Trump cornered and without friends. But, Bannon’s leaving the White House wasn’t the end of the movie, it was, simply the end of a smaller arc.\\n\\nThe Weinstein Turn\\n\\nIn writing, there is something called the “Mid-Point Turn.” It is the moment when someone does something so singular, usually bad, that it ensures things can never go back to the way they were at the beginning.\\n\\nThe fall of Harvey Weinstein is the ‘Mid-Point Turn’ for this part of the story. The lid has been blown off the abuse cycle in Hollywood. Someone finally is going down for their crimes. The guy behind the outing is still in power and the dominoes will continue to fall.\\n\\nTrump was right to lean on the NFL like he did. It galvanized his base. It exposed the hypocrisy of a hyper-violent sport played by criminals and financed by taxpayers. They think they can just stop taking a knee for a few weeks and all will be forgiven.\\n\\nNo. It won’t. The same thing with the image handlers in Hollywood. They think that isolating Weinstein, putting out rumors of rehab, etc. will make this thing go away. Harvey Weinstein is going to jail. He’s a sex offender.\\n\\nBut, the real story is how much this disrupts the money laundering cycle of the entertainment industry to maintain control over the narrative. Trump’s base already didn’t like Hollywood. Now they hate it.\\n\\nGeorge Clooney recently ranted about Steve Bannon saying,\\n\\n“Steve Bannon is a failed f**king screenwriter, and if you’ve ever read [his] screenplay, it’s unbelievable. Now, if he’d somehow managed miraculously to get that thing produced, he’d still be in Hollywood, still making movies and licking my a$$ to get me to do one of his stupid-a$$ screenplays.”\\n\\nWell, George, Bannon is right now producing one of the best screenplays I’ve read in a long time. He has power and your boy Harvey has lawyers. How’s that for an act reversal?',\n",

       " ('Authored by Whitney Webb via TheAntiMedia.org,\\n\\nCrucial to the Western narrative of the Syrian conflict is the assertion that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is a brutal dictator who has taken to killing his own people over the course of Syria’s six-year-long conflict. This allegation has been the crux of the “humanitarian” justification for foreign military intervention in Syria that would seek to depose Assad’s government, a justification frequently used by the U.S. and its allies prior to an invasion or the toppling of an extant regime.\\n\\nWhile this narrative has been pervasive in media coverage of the Syrian conflict, it is now being debunked by the very Syrian refugees that the media purported were fleeing Assad in the first place. According to a recent statement from Andrej Mahecic, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, an estimated 440,000 displaced Syrians who remained in the country have returned to their homes since the year began. In addition, 31,000 refugees in neighboring countries also returned to Syria in the first half of the year, with 260,000 having returned to Syria from other nations since 2015.\\n\\nUN Refugee Agency: Almost 500,000 Syrian refugees have returned home. Find out why: https://t.co/3N2xicy92z #UNHCR #standwithrefugees — UNA-USA San Diego (@UNASanDiego) July 1, 2017\\n\\nThough Mahecic noted that these refugees represent only a “fraction” of the five million Syrian refugees living in neighboring countries, what is notable is that nearly all of those who have decided to come back are settling in areas of Syria controlled by the government or where the Syrian government has made major territorial gains against ISIS and US-backed militants like al-Nusra Front in recent months – namely Aleppo, Hama, Homs and Damascus.\\n\\nEven with the conflict in Syria still raging, thousands of the displaced are eagerly returning to their homes under the control of the Syrian government. This may seem strange, as the U.S. media has long suggested that most refugees were fleeing Assad, not foreign-backed terrorists like Daesh (ISIS) and Al-Nusra.\\n\\nOf course, this assertion was based on “polls” of refugees conducted by the Syria Campaign, a USAID-funded organization that has long pushed for U.S. military intervention in Syria.\\n\\nThis begs the question: why would refugees choose to return to territory controlled by the person they supposedly sought to flee, as the mainstream media portrays?\\n\\nThese latest figures from the UN suggest that many refugees were not fleeing their government, but rather the violence caused by a foreign-funded insurgency intended to topple the popular Assad government. As Middle East Eye noted in 2015, prior to the outbreak of the conflict, Assad was widely popular, though his popularity allegedly evaporated as the 2011 Saudi- and U.S.-funded uprising began.\\n\\nDid Assad’s popularity with the Syrian people ever really go away? Western media reports containing interviews with the handful of Syrians who support Assad as dictator claim it is so. But the evidence has long suggested that the majority of Syrians have continued to approve of their president throughout the conflict.\\n\\nIndeed, there is plenty of evidence that the “popular uprisings” against the Assad government in 2011 were staged on behalf of foreign mercenaries largely backed by Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey – governments that have long sought to remove Assad from power. Assad’s popularity prior to the outbreak of violence likely remained unchanged after the fact.\\n\\nPolling within Syria has consistently shown this to be true. Even polls funded by anti-Assad nations like Qatar have also found that the majority of Syrians continue to overwhelmingly support Assad. Indeed, when elections were last held in 2014, the Western media could not hide the large crowds that came to vote, as the population re-elected Assad, who won with 88 percent of the vote. By contrast, voter turnout was 55.7 percent in the last U.S. Presidential election, suggesting that Assad has a stronger democratic mandate than U.S. President Donald Trump.\\n\\nSix years into the conflict, video footage, and photographs clearly show that Assad and his wife regularly walk among the Syrian people in Damascus with little to no security detail. The Assads even drive their own cars – without security – through the countryside.\\n\\nPresident #Assad druving his car and passing by a check point at ine of the villages of Mesyaf in the countryside of #Hama #Syria pic.twitter.com/XkkIvnh9bp — maytham (@maytham956) June 26, 2017\\n\\nThis seems like a difficult feat for a “hated” and “feared” dictator to perform on a regular basis. By contrast, some Western leaders can hardly spend a few minutes among their constituents – even with a massive security detail in tow – without being sped away for their own protection.\\n\\nEven U.S. politicians who have traveled to Syria have come back acknowledging Assad’s popularity. For instance, Virginia State Senator Richard Black has cited internal reports from U.S. intelligence which state that, were an election in Syria to be held today, Assad would likely be reelected with 90 percent of the vote, including in areas occupied by terrorists.',\n",

The deflationary mindset is not disappearing easily, he said.\\n\\nOn December 20, following the decision by the BOJ to keep its short-term interest-rate target at negative -0.1% and the 10-year bond yield target just above 0%, he’d brushed off criticism that this prolonged easing could destabilize Japan’s banking system. “Our most important goal is to achieve our 2% inflation target at the earliest date possible,” he said.\\n\\nOn the other hand…\\n\\nIn reality, after years of blistering asset purchases, the Bank of Japan disclosed today that total assets on its balance sheet actually inched down by ¥444 billion ($3.9 billion) from the end of November to ¥521.416 trillion on December 31. While small, it was the first month-end to month-end decline since the Abenomics-designed “QQE” kicked off in late 2012.\\n\\nUnder “QQE” – so huge that the BOJ called it Qualitative and Quantitative Easing to distinguish it from mere “QE” as practiced by the Fed at the time – the BOJ has been buying Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs), corporate bonds, Japanese REITs, and equity ETFs, leading to astounding month-end to month-end surges in the balance sheet. But now the “QQE Unwind” has commenced. Note the trend over the past 12 months and the first dip (red):\\n\\nJGBs, the largest asset class on the BOJ’s balance sheet, fell by ¥2.9 trillion ($25 billion) from November 30 to ¥440.67 trillion on December 31. In other words, the BOJ has started to unload JGBs – probably by letting them mature without replacement, rather than selling them outright.\\n\\nSome other asset classes on its balance sheet increased, including equity ETFs, Japanese REITs, “Loans,” and “Others”\\n\\nOn net, and from a distance, the first decrease of the BOJ’s assets in the era of Abenomics was barely noticeable. Total assets are still a massive pile, amounting to about 96% of Japan’s GDP (the Fed’s balance sheet amounts to about 23% of US GDP):\\n\\nThe chart below, going back to only 2016, shows how the monthly increases of the BOJ’s assets leveled off, still rising but at a slower rate – or “tapering” – since December 2016 and how in December 2017, those increases turned into the first decline since late 2012:\\n\\nNone of this – neither the 12 months of “tapering” nor now the “QQE Unwind” – was announced. They happened despite rhetoric to the contrary.\\n\\nDuring peak QQE, the 12-month period ending December 31, 2016, the BOJ added ¥93.4 trillion (about $830 billion) to its balance sheet. Over the 12-month period ending December 31, 2017, it added “only” ¥44.9 trillion to its balance sheet. That’s down 52% from the peak.\\n\\nThis chart shows the rolling 12-month change in the balance sheet in trillion yen, going back to the Financial Crisis:\\n\\nThe BOJ has used QQE as an internationally accepted pretext to bring Japan’s public debt under control by effectively removing much of it from the market in order to prevent a Greek-like debt crisis. And it worked.\\n\\nJapan’s national debt reached 250% of GDP at the end of 2016, by far the highest in the world. Between the JGB holdings by the BOJ and by state-owned institutions, such as the Government Pension and Investment Fund, Japanese authorities now control the majority of Japan’s national debt, and there won’t be a debt crisis – though it could trigger other crises. And it appears that the BOJ decided that this might be enough control. Hence the end of QQE.\\n\\nThe Fed leads — The Fed’s QE Unwind is really happening — and other central banks follow.\\n\\nThe ECB began tapering in April 2017, slashing its monthly asset purchases from €80 billion to €60 billion. As of January 2018, the ECB has tapered further, cutting its monthly purchases to €30 billion. But unlike the BOJ, the ECB communicated this tapering via rumors, speeches, and finally press conferences that were spread all over the media.\\n\\nSo the high-octane QE juice that has powered global financial markets for years is beginning to evaporate, with the ECB being the last but fading holdout among the biggest central banks.\\n\\nCentral banks are leery of the newly arrived Chinese yuan.

The piece is a bit breathless:\\n\\nStanding on the hill at dawn, overseeing a team of 40 Kurdish diggers, the German-born archeologist waves a hand over his discovery here, a revolution in the story of human origins. Schmidt has uncovered a vast and beautiful temple complex, a structure so ancient that it may be the very first thing human beings ever built. The site isn’t just old, it redefines old: the temple was built 11,500 years ago—a staggering 7,000 years before the Great Pyramid, and more than 6,000 years before Stonehenge first took shape. The ruins are so early that they predate villages, pottery, domesticated animals, and even agriculture—the first embers of civilization. In fact, Schmidt thinks the temple itself, built after the end of the last Ice Age by hunter-gatherers, became that ember— the spark that launched mankind toward farming, urban life, and all that followed.\\n\\nA trivial point is that it was a spark at most, not the spark, as there are at least two independent sequences of the origination of agriculture leading to cities and the complex of cultural traits which we label “civilization.” A larger point is that I suspect it is incredible to us that hunter-gatherers could engage in such coordination because our model of what hunter-gatherers are capable of is constrained to Arctic peoples, the Bushmen and the Pygmies, and these populations are selection biased toward marginal lands which agriculturists were unable to exploit. In contrast, hunter-gatherers before agriculture were resident in much richer territory, and probably had more complex societies than we’re used to imagining. Probably something closer to the native populations of the North American Pacific Northwest.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe relevance of this to faith is immense. If (as a believer, particularly of an Abrahamic faith) you accept the view that religion is a revelation from God to mankind, then the tempe at Göbekli Tepe really has potential to provide a meaningful narrative for that relationship. But the temple complex offers deep insights into human prehistory far beyond theological insights – it is a outlier in that a similar complex structure would not be built for five millenia later, in Iraq. It is such a mystery that the first archaeologist to discover it in the 60s was simply unable to process what he saw and walked away! The bottom line is that with these temples, we see a glimpse of humanity at the cusp, not of civilization, but of understanding that there is more to existence than merely existing. The idea of the existence of the divine -the awakening from mere survival (post Ice Age) into a broader philosophical curiosity about why we are here and Who put us here – must have been like an ideological nuke to our forebears. It was literally Revelation, and perhaps it occurred there, at Göbekli Tepe , for the first time.\\n\\nOn another issue, a friend who is like me a religious unbeliever wondered via email if Aziz’s jump to suggesting that Göbekli Tepe might be a glimpse into the first revelation was going a bit too far. I think the issue here is that Aziz, and many followers of the Abrahamic religions, simply start with different premises and so interpret these data through their own lens. His comment is open about his own perspective and how it colors his interpretation:\\n\\nThe idea that humanity began with a primal monotheism is not exclusive to Islam. Many conservative Christians, and I presume many Jews as well, accept this as a factual aspect of our species’ history. Adam and Noah were monotheists, and the panoply of religious traditions which were extant when Abrahamic monotheism began its meteoric rise is viewed from this perspective as degeneration from the original religion. The influence of initial framework is particularly stark when it comes to interpreting Mesopotamiam antiquities, conservative Christian friends of mine in high school saw in references to a flood in Sumerian mythology as validation of the Biblical story. That is, independent sources of confirmation of truths which they knew from revelation. In contrast, I inferred that these were in fact likely to be the source documents of the myths recorded in the Hebrew Bible.\\n\\nBut the second paragraph I have more issues with. I do not see in the existence of complex temples as any indication of philosophical theism. The Aztecs had complex temples, but they were manifestly barbaric, and arguably inhumane. If, for example, the excavators discovered human remains whose condition implied violent death and likely their sacrifice I assume Aziz would revise his assessment about the Göbekli Tepe complex. Or perhaps become a gnostic!\\n\\nThe full flower of philosophical reflection, and its synthesis with ethics and religion, is clear in the historical record, and goes by the term the Axial Age. It occurred on the order of 2,500 years ago. If it occurred at Göbekli Tepe it was lost to us in the interregnum. But I do not believe this is what happened, I suspect that the glimmers of such reflection, or at least the psychological atoms necessary to construct introspective philosophy and exploration of transcendence, has roots in behavioral modernity, on the order of 50,000 years ago (though I admit that my confidence in this is modest, and not high). In other words, I would bet that some humans were aware of their own mortality, and pondered their relation to the order of things, as they were leaving Africa. But only with the rise of complex societies which were open to sustainable rent-seeking could these humans transform their own personal reflections into the framework around which humanity ostensibly operated.',\n",

       " ('BOOKS IN BRIEF\\n\\nThe Year of Magical Thinking by Joan Didion (Knopf, 227 pp., $23.95). I know, it seems downright cruel to fault a book written by a woman who lost a husband after more than forty years of marriage while their daughter, in and out of hospitals, died almost 20 months to the day after her father. Obviously this is a time to try any soul most bitterly.\\n\\nJoan Didion has some twelve works--fiction and nonfiction--to her credit. Perhaps it was all too understandable for her as a writer to want to try to make some--any--sense at all out of the \"weeks and then months that cut loose any fixed idea I ever had about death, about illness . . . about marriage and children and memory . . . about the shallowness of sanity, about life itself.\"\\n\\nBut actually how much do we learn of life, illness, death, marriage, or memory from this book that one sincerely hopes brought at least some measure of therapeutic ease to its author? I read it with considerable interest, having not that long ago entered the unhappy state of widowhood myself after more than fifty-three years of marriage. Yes, as Didion notes, you are constantly replaying bits, pieces, scenes from memories you had thought long forgotten. Your mind is never still.\\n\\nMy husband Richard and I had met Didion and her husband John Gregory Dunne way back in the early eighties. Richard wound up talking with Didion through the meal as she told him in great detail of her great-grandparents, who had made the arduous trip across the desert to settle in California. Off and on over the years he would recall that conversation, always admiring her for her pride in the grit it had taken her family to make that perilous journey.\\n\\nDidion continually recollects bits, pieces, snatches, scenes of a past formed by joined lives as the days go by. But her telling perhaps is still too raw to bring any real meaning or insight to such an experience. One of the things I found disturbing, or at the very least curious, in her book was how in attempting to come to terms with her grief she glides over the whole question of, well, the afterlife.\\n\\nShe talks of having a priest come to the hospital after Dunne had died, and having both a Catholic and an Episcopal priest officiate at Dunne\\'s funeral services at St. John the Divine in New York, but that\\'s about it as far as any role religion seems to have played in their lives. She devotes rather more space to what Emily Post had to say back in a 1922 edition of her book on etiquette about comforting the grieving individual, offering \"a little hot tea or broth.\"\\n\\nShe does talk of not wanting to give away Dunne\\'s shoes, since \"he would need shoes if he was to return.\" She says at a later point, \"I did not believe in the resurrection of the body but I still believed that given the right circumstances he would come back.\" This is part, I suppose, of the eponymous magical thinking that went on in her year of grief.\\n\\nIn talking over Didion\\'s book in recent days with two fellow widows, long married to brilliant and talented men, none of us felt she had come anywhere near expressing our own thoughts on the experience. And one woman, who had lost one of the finest minds of his generation, said what she missed every day, every night, was \"the conversation.\" The other two of us exclaimed, virtually wailed, \"Yes, that\\'s exactly it. The conversation.\" Our men had been great talkers. The intertwining of ideas, judgments, memories--the very texture of our lives for decades--were now irretrievably cut off from us. We keep on inevitably, but we know we\\'re so much the poorer for the time that remains.\\n\\nDidion closes her book leaving us with the thought, \"if we are to live our lives there comes a point at which we must relinquish the dead, let them go, keep them dead.\" I don\\'t agree. The dead--our special dead--keep living as long as we do. Yes, conversation is no longer present, a sad factor, but the spirit lives as long as we do.\\n\\nNow, for Didion, she has the sad mission of writing another book mourning the death of her daughter. You can only pity the small, pitiful waif of a persona she presents to us, doggedly going on about her book tour.\\n\\n--Cynthia Grenier',\n",

However, a few months later, Buena Vista Television sent a second letter retracting its prior calculations.

A member of the Cumberland County Commission, where Mechanicsburg is located, quickly raised her voice and exclaimed, “Agri-terrorism.” Other Commissioners, however, more calmly wondered why the state had taken such interest in the local seed lending library, one among some 340 community libraries across the country at that time which had small seed-sharing programs.\\n\\nSeeds brought to the library are carefully labeled, placed in small paper or plastic envelopes, then filed, typically using those wooden card catalogs of yesterday.

       " ('Back in May, the New York Times scored one of their biggest \\'hits\\' to date on Trump when they secured 4 memos drafted by James Comey allegedly summarizing direct conversations with the President (we covered it here: Comey\\'s Revenge: Leaks Memo To NYT Saying Trump Asked Him To End Flynn Investigation). Among other things, the memos asserted that Trump directly asked Comey to end his investigation of Michael Flynn and to pledge \"loyalty\" to him.\\n\\nOf course, as we all know by now, Comey did not pass his memos directly to the New York Times but instead used an intermediary, Columbia University Law School professor Daniel Richman. Now, Richman told CNN in July that none of the memos he received were marked \"classified\" but, according to a new letter sent to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein yesterday by Chuck Grassley, that may not have been entirely accurate.\\n\\nAs Grassley notes, 4 of the 7 Comey memos that he reviewed at the FBI were \"marked classified at the “SECRET” or “CONFIDENTIAL” levels.\" Moreover, since Richman received 4 memos, simple mathematical realities would dictate that at least of them contained material that the FBI now considers classified.\\n\\nMy staff has since reviewed these memoranda in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) at the FBI, and I reviewed them in a SCIF at the Office of Senate Security. The FBI insisted that these reviews take place in a SCIF because the majority of the memos are classified. Of the seven memos, four are marked classified at the “SECRET” or “CONFIDENTIAL” levels. Only three did not contain classified information. According to press reports, Professor Daniel Richman of Columbia Law School stated that Mr. Comey provided him four of the seven memoranda and encouraged him to “detail [Comey’s] memos to the press.” If it’s true that Professor Richman had four of the seven memos, then in light of the fact that four of the seven memos the Committee reviewed are classified, it would appear that at least one memo the former FBI director gave Professor Richman contained classified information. Professor Richman later read a portion of one of the memos to a New York Times reporter.\\n\\nFor those who missed it, here is what Richman told CNN about the classification of the memos he shared with the New York Times:\\n\\nAccording to CNN, Daniel Richman, with whom Comey shared at least one memo the contents of which Richman shared with New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt, said President Trump was wrong in accusing Comey of sharing classified information with journalists. \"No memo was given to me that was marked \\'classified,\\'\" Daniel Richman told CNN. \"No memo was passed on to the Times.\" Well, not quite: Richman did share the contents of one memo, he said, but \"the substance of the memo passed on to the Times was not marked classified and to my knowledge remains unclassified.\"\\n\\nAs you may recall, during his June 2017 testimony Comey said he specifically wrote the memos to avoid including classified information to make them \"easier to discuss.\"\\n\\n\"My thinking was, if I write it in such a way that I don\\'t include anything that would trigger a classification, that\\'ll make it easier for us to discuss, within the FBI and the government, and to -- to hold on to it in a way that makes it accessible to us,\" Comey told senators.\\n\\nAnd here, as in the case of Hillary Clinton, is where the problem emerges, because what Comey considered not confidential - just like Clinton - has differed from others\\' opinion. In other words, whether he wrote or rewrote the memos to make the leak \"easier\" - which also begs the question what else was redacted or added to the original content - the confidential information remained...at least in the opinion of someone within the Department of Justice.\\n\\nOf course, as we all know well by now, mishandling classified information and/or making false statements to the FBI is only a crime if you\\'re a Republican and/or not part of the Deep State.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nHere is the full Chuck Grassley Letter to Rosenstein:\\n\\nDear Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein:\\n\\n\\n\\nThis Committee has previously written to the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation about the memoranda that former Director Comey created purportedly memorializing his interactions with President Trump.[1] My staff has since reviewed these memoranda in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) at the FBI, and I reviewed them in a SCIF at the Office of Senate Security. The FBI insisted that these reviews take place in a SCIF because the majority of the memos are classified. Of the seven memos, four are marked classified at the “SECRET” or “CONFIDENTIAL” levels. Only three did not contain classified information. FBI personnel refused to answer factual questions during the document reviews, including questions about the chain of custody of the documents I was reviewing, the date that they were marked classified, and who marked them as classified.\\n\\nAccording to press reports, Professor Daniel Richman of Columbia Law School stated that Mr. Comey provided him four of the seven memoranda and encouraged him to “detail [Comey’s] memos to the press.”[2] If it’s true that Professor Richman had four of the seven memos, then in light of the fact that four of the seven memos the Committee reviewed are classified, it would appear that at least one memo the former FBI director gave Professor Richman contained classified information.[3] Professor Richman later read a portion of one of the memos to a New York Times reporter.[4]\\n\\nWhen the Committee contacted Professor Richman seeking copies of the memos Mr. Comey had provided him, he refused to provide them, did not say how many he had received from Mr. Comey, and refused to say whether he retained copies.[5] It is unclear whether any of the memos reviewed by the Committee were retrieved from Professor Richman. The Committee has accordingly not determined which of the seven memos Mr. Comey provided him. Professor Richman did tell Committee investigators that he was working with the Special Counsel’s Office, and he reportedly told the media that he had turned over to the FBI copies of the memos he’d received from Mr. Comey.[6] If true, the Justice Department should know which memos were provided and be able to share that information with the Committee.\\n\\nIn order for the Committee to further assess this situation, please respond to the following in writing by no later than January 17, 2018:\\n\\nHas the Justice Department or FBI in fact determined that any of the memoranda Mr. Comey sent Professor Richman contained classified information? If so, what steps were taken to retrieve and safeguard the information? Which of the seven memoranda the FBI made available for the Committee’s review did Mr. Comey give to Professor Richman? When did Mr. Comey give Professor Richman the memoranda?\\n\\nAt the time that Professor Richman received the memoranda, were any marked as classified?\\n\\nAt the time that Professor Richman received the memoranda, did any contain classified information, regardless of markings?\\n\\nPlease explain the method by which Mr. Comey transmitted the memoranda to Professor Richman. If the transmittal was electronic:\\n\\nPlease provide the account information that Mr. Comey and Mr. Richman used.\\n\\nPlease describe what steps the FBI has taken to recover all copies of any classified memoranda that might reside on computers, servers, or at other locations. Have you initiated an investigation into the matter of whether Mr. Comey improperly disclosed classified information by providing these memoranda to Professor Richman? If so, what is the status of the investigation? If not, why not? Has there been any review of whether the disclosure of the memoranda by Mr. Comey was otherwise improper, such as whether it violated his employment agreement or any Department rule or policy? If so, what is the status of the review? If not, why not? When did the FBI mark the four memoranda as classified, and who made the classification decision? As noted above, it has been reported that Professor Richman returned the memoranda to the FBI.[7] If so, on what date did this occur? Did anyone from the FBI or Special Counsel’s Office discuss with Professor Richman this Committee’s request for copies of the memos? If so, please provide all records related to any such communications. Does Professor Richman still have possession of any of the memoranda or copies?\\n\\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

But when Right to Rise first floated the attack that Rubio\\'s pro-life stance made him unelectable, leading pro-life voices called on Jeb Bush to make it clear publicly that he opposed it. As National Review\\'s Ramesh Ponnuru wrote at the time:\\n\\nIt should go without saying that for Bush-backers to attack Rubio in this manner would badly hurt Bush\\'s already weak campaign. Some pro-lifers agree with Rubio\\'s view; even those who do not would in many cases dislike pro-life infighting. (I suspect Bush himself is sympathetic to Rubio\\'s position: Note the words \"in the public square\" in this clip.) Bush cannot control Right to Rise, but he can and should make it clear that he opposes attacks on Rubio\\'s pro-life views.\\n\\nWhen asked about Right to Rise\\'s criticism of Rubio\\'s pro-life stance, Bush said: \"Look, I don\\'t think anybody should be critical of someone who\\'s pro-life, because I\\'m the most pro-life candidate on that stage.\"\\n\\nIn the run-up to the New Hampshire primary, Bush seems to have changed his mind.

This is not an easy decision, but Marco will have to explain that position.\" Bush did not acknowledge that Rubio supports legislation that includes such an exception. In Saturday\\'s debate, Bush\\'s criticism was milder. \"Others may have a different view and I respect it,\" he said. \"But I think we have to be cognizant of the fact there\\'s a lot of people that are concerned about having a pro-life position without any exceptions.\"\\n\\nWhen Bush said in November that he didn\\'t \"think anybody should be critical of someone who\\'s pro-life,\" perhaps he simply forgot to add the words \"until the Iowa caucuses are over.\"',\n",

It is now $230Bn.\\n\\nToday, a little over two years later, the US Treasury has figured this out, and on Friday Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he will work with the Group of 20 nations to prevent cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin from becoming the digital equivalent of an anonymous Swiss bank account.\\n\\n\"We are very focused on cryptocurrencies,\" Mnuchin explained, pointing to discussions with other regulators within the U.S. government and later stating: \"We want to make sure that bad people cannot use these currencies to do bad things.\"\\n\\nSpeaking at the Economic Club of Washington, Mnuchin said that the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a government body that assesses financial system risks, has formed a working group focused on cryptocurrencies, and explained that \"In the United States — and people may not realize this — under our laws, if you have a wallet to own bitcoins, that company has the same obligation as a bank to Know Your Customer. So, in the United States, we have rules for anti-money-laundering, for all different types of entities, we can track those types of [transactions]. The rest of the world doesn’t have that. So one of the things we are working very closely with the G-20 on is making sure that this doesn’t become the Swiss numbered bank account.\"\\n\\nDuring the remarks, Mnuchin also suggested that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to develop its own digital version of fiat currency – a topic under discussion at a number of central banks worldwide – in the near future.\\n\\n\"The Fed and we don\\'t think there\\'s a need for that at this point,\" Mnuchin said.\\n\\nMnuchin added that he was worried about heightened levels of speculation in the bitcoin market. \"The other concern I have is, there’s a lot of speculation in this, and I want to make sure that consumers who are trading this understand the risks,” Mnuchin said. “I am concerned that consumers may get hurt.\"\\n\\nApparently he was far less concerned about consumers buying the S&P at all time high valuations.\\n\\nMore to the point, yes the US will gladly tax crypto trading now that the total market cap of all \"coins\" is $700 billion, and no, it has no intention of cracking down on bitcoin or other cryptos.\\n\\nMnuchin also said that Mnuchin also said that he is “not at all” worried that Russia may use cryptocurrencies to help its banks avoid international sanctions. An adviser to President Vladimir Putin is reported to have said that sanctions against Russia have created a need for digital currencies as officials there fear expansions in 2018.\\n\\nAs we reported in December, Russian PM Dmitry Medvedev signed a decree allowing the government to classify purchases by the Defense Ministry, Federal Security Service and Foreign Intelligence Service as state secrets.\\n\\n“This idea that Russia or Venezuela can thwart the pressure from sanctions just by developing their own cryptocurrency is silly,” lawyer Erich Ferrari of Ferrari & Associates told Bloomberg. \"It’s like trying to do it by using cash.

       " (\"Back on October 18, a blog for the NY Daily News (via Kausfiles) reported that a Chicago real estate appraiser was claiming in his wrongful termination suit that his ex-employer had inflated the appraisal of the strip of land which Tony Rezko’s wife bought at the same June 2005 closing at which Sen. Obama bought his stately home. The blog said:\\n\\nWe have no idea of the merits of the case … But the fact that the suit has been filed brings back yet another item that Team Obama would rather not have to deal with in the closing days of the contest.\\n\\nOf course, Team Obama didn’t have to deal with it, just as they didn’t have to deal with much of anything.\\n\\nThe Washington Times reported on Election Day:\\n\\nA former Illinois real estate specialist says FBI agents have questioned him about a Chicago property that had been bought by convicted felon Tony Rezko‘s wife and later sold to the couple’s next-door neighbor, Sen. Barack Obama. The real estate specialist, Kenneth J. Conner, said bank officials replaced an appraisal review he prepared on the property and FBI agents were investigating in late 2007 whether the Rezko-Obama deal was proper. “Agents and I talked about payoff, bribe, kickback for a long time, though it took them only a short number of minutes of talking with me while looking at the appraisal to acknowledge what they already seemed to know: The Rezko lot was grossly overvalued,” Mr. Conner told The Washington Times Monday. “Rezko paid the asking price on the same day Obama paid $300,000 less than the asking price to the same seller for his adjacent mansion,” he said. “This begs the question of payoff, bribe, kickback.”\\n\\nTo be pedantic, it raises the question …\\n\\nAccording to his complaint, Mr. Conner reviewed the appraisal of the Rezko property by another firm, Adams Appraisal, which had set the value at $625,000. The complaint said he told his bosses the property had been overvalued by at least $125,000 and that a “reasonable and fair evaluation” should have been no greater than $500,000. Mr. Conner said the removal of his appraisal “seemed understood as a crime with respect to the subpoena” of the Rezko property and the FDIC audit.\\n\\nWell, who knows? There was a housing bubble going on and appraisers were doing a lot of screwy things in 2005.\\n\\nBut Blagogate has reminded the country that they just elected a Chicago politician to the White House.\\n\\nAnd the appraiser’s contention that his bosses inflated the value of the land Rezko purchased adjoining Obama’s house at the same closing fits in with the low-level general fishiness of the deal.\\n\\nAs you’ll recall, the Obamas got $300,000 knocked off the asking price of the house, while the Rezkos paid the full $625,000 asking price for their adjoining property. Think about it from your point of view. You see a house that you want to buy, but the price is steep. The sellers own both the house and a big side yard, which might be big enough to build another house on (or might not, depending on a complicated web of development rules in this historic district). They are willing to sell the two pieces of land separately and have published separate prices for them.\\n\\nYou call up an old friend and have him come look at the property with you. On closing day, his wife shows up and buys the side lot while you buy the big house, meaning that the sellers unload everything, which is obviously of interest to the sellers.\\n\\nThe sellers wind up with $300,000 less than their asking price for the two pieces of land together.\\n\\nQuestion: How do you and your old buddy divvy up the $300,000 discount? I would assume that most friends would split it pro-rata based on the asking prices, which means that Rezko would have gotten about $70,000 off. If the discount was split unevenly, the normal thing would be for the person doing the favor to get more. And clearly, Obama was asking a favor of Rezko — he called Rezko about the property, not the other way around. So, if you aren’t going to split it pro rata, then Rezko should get more.\\n\\nInstead, Rezko got none of the $300,000 and Obama got all of it.\\n\\nThe Chicago papers had reported back in March 2005, several months before Rezko and Obama bought the land at the same closing, that Rezko had illegally gotten the Panda Express franchises at O’Hare by claiming they were actually minority-owned and operated, that minority being Jabir Muhammad, the son of the notorious Black Muslim leader Elijah Muhammad. So, Obama would have known about Rezko being a crook just from reading the newspapers.\\n\\nOf course, no doubt Obama knew far more about Rezko’s Rezkoness than what was making the papers. But, still he went ahead with the deal. It’s the Chicago Way.\\n\\nThis $70,000 isn’t the biggest deal in the world. Bill Clinton doesn’t get out of bed for $70,000. It’s precisely its yuppie size that makes it interesting: What would you do for $70,000?\\n\\nThat’s an interesting amount of money… It’s not one of these hypothetical questions — “Would you do something immoral for $100 million?” — that sophomores like like to discuss. Instead, it’s the kind of money that you can imagine having dangled before you at some point.\\n\\nDid Rezko owe Obama a favor? Sure, Obama had been chairman of the Illinois Senate committe on Health and Human Services for the past two years, during which time Rezko had come to corruptly control the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board, which picked winners in the contest to build big hospitals. Obama played a helpful role in Rezko’s gang getting picked to build a hospital. See, Rezko owned 5 of the 15 board members, so he wanted the board “streamlined” from 15 to 9 in the interests of “efficiency,” which gave him a majority of 5 of 9. RezkoWatch pointed out:\\n\\nA review of senate records shows Obama played a major role in pushing through Senate Bill 1332, that led to the “Illinois Health Facilities Planning Act,” which reduced the number of members on the Board from 15 to 9, making the votes much easier to rig. Democratic Senator Susan Garrett sponsored the bill, and the co-sponsor was Republican Senator Dale Righter. These two senators were also on the Human Services Committee with Obama. The bill was assigned to the Committee for review on February 27, 2003. As chairman, Obama sent word to the full senate that the bill should be passed on March 13. Blagojevich made the effective date June 27, 2003, and the co-schemers already had the people lined up to stack the Board and rig the votes with full approval from Obama. A June 2003 email exchange produced in the trial shows Obama received the names of the nominees for the Board ahead of time, from the office of David Wilhelm, who headed Blagojevich’s 2002 campaign. Rezko’s attorney made the point to the jury that the email was from Blagojevich’s general counsel and Wilhelm’s office, and indicated the appointees were recommended by Wilhelm and supported by those who received the memo. The new Senate bill said, the “Board shall be appointed by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate.” But the Senate Confirmation Hearings were a joke. For instance, the Feds recorded Levine talking to co-schemer, Jon Bauman, the day Levine learned he was approved by the Senate from the executive secretary of the Board. He told Levine Senate President, Emil Jones [Obama's godfather in the Senate], only allowed 2 members to be approved and “that was you and the other person he just put in.” “Isn’t that hysterical ’cause you know they had this big battle going on,” Levine told Bauman, “don’t you just love it.” “I’m one of those independents and not part of the block.” “Well, good, you know it’s good to be just a true independent civil servant,” Bauman said laughing along with Levine. “Is, is that a good thing,” Levine replied, “I’ve never been that.” The corrupt new appointees were all contributors to the presidential hopeful, Rod Blagojevich, and the US senate hopeful Obama. The Board’s then sitting-chairman, Thomas Beck, appointed by a Republican governor, testified under a grant of immunity that he brought a $1,000 check to Rezko on July 15, 2003, to make sure Blagojevich reappointed him. Beck also testified that Rezko told him Blagojevich was set to appoint Rezko’s three doctor friends to complete the rigged voting bloc. Dr Michel Malek gave Obama $10,000 a little over a month before the first Board meeting on June 30, 2003. He also donated $25,000 to Blagojevich three weeks later on July 25, 2003, and gave Obama another $500 in September 2003. Dr Fortunee Massuda donated $25,000 to Blagojevich on July 25, 2003, and gave a total of $2,000 to Obama on different dates. Massuda’s husband, Charles Hannon, is a co-schemer in the pension fund case and testified against Rezko in the trial. Dr Imad Almanaseer contributed a total of $3,000 to Obama after he landed the appointment. On March 13, 2008, Almanaseer testified against Rezko and told the jury he was an investor in Rezko’s fast-food businesses.\\n\\nYou’ll notice the Middle Eastern flavor to Rezko’s flunkies. In Chicago, Arab operators like Rezko don’t control enough votes to matter, so they have to pay to play.\\n\\nWe’re not used to thinking of health as a corrupt field. Yet, as bankrobber Willie Sutton answered when asked why he robs banks: That’s where the money is. The health industry is, what, $2 trillion per year. So, it naturally attracts operators like Tony Rezko … and politicians like Barack Obama.\\n\\nYou can read more about what attracted Obama to Chicago — of all places — to make his political career in my new book, a reader’s guide to Barack Obama’s autobiography, America’s Half-Blood Prince: Barack Obama’s “Story of Race and Inheritance,” which you can buy here.\",\n",

       " ('Bacteria Share Light Spectrum with Plant Leaves\\n\\nBY BRIAN THOMAS, M.S. * | TUESDAY, DECEMBER 06, 2011\\n\\nPlant leaves convert light into chemical energy for use in cells. Their biochemistry specifically absorbs the blue and red areas of the visible light spectrum. Now researchers have discovered that light-harvesting bacteria living on the surfaces of leaves gather energy from the green part of the spectrum, meaning that they cooperate rather than compete with plants. How did this perfectly balanced energy-sharing system come about?\\n\\nKnowing that light-harvesting microbes live in aquatic environments, the researchers tested the hypothesis that similar bacteria live on leaves. They were right. And the light that the microbes gather was \"compatible with the plant\\'s photosynthesis,\" resulting in \"a significant ecological advantage to microbes inhabiting this environment.\"1 In other words, bacteria take full advantage of all the green light that plants don\\'t use.\\n\\nIn a study published online in Environmental Microbiology, the research team screened genetic material from the surfaces of different leaves harvested from an oasis near the Dead Sea. They found genetic codes for specific types of rhodopsins, which are molecules that capture light. Some enable sight in vertebrate eyes, but many of the rhodopsins found on leaf surfaces were part of light-gathering apparatuses used by bacteria as tiny energy generators called \"light-driven proton pumps.\"1\\n\\nThe researchers found that the bacteria absorb the most light at exactly the same point where plants absorb no light. This way, more plant growth cooperatively provides more living space and fuel for the bacteria.\\n\\nCharles Darwin proposed that natural selection developed all living systems through a \"struggle for life.\"2 He imagined that competition between creatures built new biological structures to make them more fit to survive. But the specific biochemicals of these plants and bacteria enable them to cooperate without competing.3\\n\\nNot only does the sharing of ecosystem resources between these species—as between plants and animals—indicate design,4 but the ingenious machinery required to capture and convert light into useful cellular energy points to an Engineer of surpassing brilliance.5\\n\\nThis was emphasized by yet another observation. The researchers found that the bacteria use some of their rhodopsins as light sensors so they can most effectively use the energy available to them. \"This suggests that microorganisms in the phyllosphere [leaf surfaces] are intensively engaged in light sensing, to accommodate the effects of fluctuations in light quality, intensity and UV radiation at the leaf surface,\" according to the study authors.1\\n\\nBoth the tiny interlocking parts of biochemical energy machines and the interlocking purposes of totally different co-existing organisms show that life was designed by a divine Genius.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAtamna-Ismaeel, N. et al.

       " ('Barack Obama and the Federal Reserve are lying to you. The “economic recovery” that we all keep hearing about is mostly just a mirage. The percentage of Americans that are employed has barely budged since the depths of the last recession, the labor force participation rate is at a 36 year low, the overall rate of homeownership is the lowest that it has been in nearly 20 years and approximately 49 percent of all Americans are financially dependent on the government at this point. In a recent article, I shared 12 charts that clearly demonstrate the permanent damage that has been done to our economy over the last decade. The response to that article was very strong. Many people were quite upset to learn that they were not being told the truth by our politicians and by the mainstream media. Sadly, the vast majority of Americans still have absolutely no idea what is being done to our economy. For those out there that still believe that we are doing “just fine”, here are 19 more facts about the messed up state of the U.S. economy…\\n\\n#1 After accounting for inflation, median household income in the United States is 8 percent lower than it was when the last recession started in 2007.\\n\\n#2 The number of part-time workers in America has increased by 54 percent since the last recession began in December 2007. Meanwhile, the number of full-time jobs has dropped by more than a million over that same time period.\\n\\n#3 More than 7 million Americans that are currently working part-time jobs would actually like to have full-time jobs.\\n\\n#4 The jobs gained during this “recovery” pay an average of 23 percent less than the jobs that were lost during the last recession.\\n\\n#5 The number of unemployed workers that have completely given up looking for work is twice as high now as it was when the last recession began in December 2007.\\n\\n#6 When the last recession began, about 17 percent of all unemployed workers had been out of work for six months or longer. Today, that number sits at just above 34 percent.\\n\\n#7 Due to a lack of decent jobs, half of all college graduates are still relying on their parents financially when they are two years out of school.\\n\\n#8 According to a new method of calculating poverty devised by the U.S. Census Bureau, the state of California currently has a poverty rate of 23.4 percent.\\n\\n#9 According to the New York Times, the “typical American household” is now worth 36 percent less than it was worth a decade ago.\\n\\n#10 In 2007, the average household in the top 5 percent had 16.5 times as much wealth as the average household overall. But now the average household in the top 5 percent has 24 times as much wealth as the average household overall.\\n\\n#11 In an absolutely stunning development, the rate of small business ownership in the United States has plunged to an all-time low.\\n\\n#12 Subprime loans now make up 31 percent of all auto loans in America. Didn’t that end up really badly when the housing industry tried the same thing?\\n\\n#13 The average cost of producing a barrel of shale oil in the United States is approximately 85 dollars. Now that the price of oil is starting to slip under that number, the “shale boom” in America could turn into a bust very rapidly.\\n\\n#14 On a purchasing power basis, China now actually has a larger economy than the United States does.\\n\\n#15 It is hard to believe, but there are 49 million people that are dealing with food insecurity in America today.\\n\\n#16 There are six banks in the United States that pretty much everyone agrees fit into the “too big to fail” category. Five of them have more than 40 trillion dollars of exposure to derivatives.\\n\\n#17 The 113 top earning employees at the Federal Reserve headquarters in Washington D.C. make an average of $246,506 a year. It turns out that ruining the U.S. economy is a very lucrative profession.\\n\\n#18 We are told that the federal deficit is under control, but the truth is that the U.S. national debt increased by more than a trillion dollars during fiscal year 2014.\\n\\n#19 An astounding 40 million dollars has been spent just on vacations for Barack Obama and his family. Perhaps he figures that if we are going down as a nation anyway, he might as well enjoy the ride.\\n\\nIf our economy truly was “recovering”, there would be lots of good paying middle class jobs available.\\n\\nBut that is not the case at all.\\n\\nI know so many people in their prime working years that spend day after day searching for a job. Most of them never seem to get anywhere. It isn’t because they don’t have anything to offer. It is just that the labor market is absolutely saturated with qualified job seekers.\\n\\nFor example, USA Today recently shared the story of 42-year-old Alex Gomez…\\n\\n“I’ve had to seriously downgrade my living situation,” said Alex Gomez, a 42-year-old with a master’s degree in entrepreneurship. Gomez lost his last full-time job in 2009 and has been looking for work since a short-term contract position ended in 2012. Gomez’s home was foreclosed on, so the Tampa resident lives with three roommates in a college neighborhood. He drained his 401(k) trying to save his house, and he has around $150,000 in student loans. His mother is tapping her 401(k) to pay his rent. Gomez subsists on that and about $200 a month in food stamps. “I have been applying and looking for pretty much anything at this stage,” he said. Although he’s looking for work in engineering or data management, “I applied to a supermarket as a deli clerk because I used to be a deli clerk as a teenager,” he said. He was told he was overqualified and turned down.\\n\\nDoes Alex Gomez have gifts and abilities to share with our society?\\n\\nOf course he does.\\n\\nSo why can’t he find a job?\\n\\nIt is because we have a broken economy.\\n\\nWe are in the midst of a long-term economic decline and the system simply does not work properly anymore.\\n\\nAnd thanks to decades of very foolish decisions, this is only the start of our problems.\\n\\nThings are only going to get worse from here.',\n",

       " ('Barack Obama has greatly expanded the powers of the presidency during his time in the White House, but there is one institution that he simply will not mess with. There is one organization that is considered to be so sacred in Washington D.C. that Obama will not dare utter a single negative word against it. That organization is the Federal Reserve. Even though he has shown that he is unafraid to pick a fight with just about everyone else in Washington, Obama flat out refuses to criticize the Fed and he even reappointed Ben Bernanke for another term as Fed Chairman even though Bernanke has a track record of failure that would make the Chicago Cubs look good. Perhaps Obama is aware of what has happened to other presidents that have chosen to tangle with the Fed. In any event, it has become clear that Obama submits to anything that the Fed says without question, and the controversy over the “trillion dollar coin” is another perfect example of this. For weeks, there has been much speculation in the mainstream media about the possibility that the Obama administration may print up a one trillion dollar coin that it would use to keep paying the bills of the federal government if an agreement to raise the debt ceiling is not reached. But on Saturday the Federal Reserve killed that idea, and we shouldn’t be surprised by that because under no circumstances will the Fed ever accept a threat to their monopoly over money creation in the United States. If the Federal Reserve had allowed Obama to print up a debt-free trillion dollar coin, that would have set a very dangerous precedent for the Fed. The American people would have realized that the federal government can actually create debt-free money whenever it wants and that it does not actually have to borrow money from anyone. That is something that the Fed probably would have moved heaven and earth to keep from happening. But now we won’t ever know how far the Fed would really be willing to go to keep their monopoly over money creation, because Obama has no plans to challenge this latest ruling from “the real boss” of our financial system.\\n\\nSadly, most Americans don’t even realize that a private banking cartel has a monopoly over all money creation in this country. In recent years they have abused this power by wildly printing money (“quantitative easing“), and by making more than 16 trillion dollars in secret loans to their friends during the last financial crisis. Under our system, the private Federal Reserve creates money whenever they want, and nobody else gets to create money. It is an insane system, but very, very few of our politicians will ever dare to question it.\\n\\nAt this point, the U.S. Treasury Department is essentially just an arm of the Federal Reserve. That is why it was no surprise that the Fed and the Treasury Department issued a joint statement on Saturday. According to Treasury spokesman Anthony Coley, both the Treasury and the Fed have come to the conclusion that under no circumstances should a trillion dollar coin be printed up by the Obama administration…\\n\\n“Neither the Treasury Department nor the Federal Reserve believes that the law can or should be used to facilitate the production of platinum coins for the purpose of avoiding an increase in the debt limit”\\n\\nBut of course it was actually the Federal Reserve which made this decision. The following is from a report posted by Zeke Miller of Buzzfeed.com…\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve was responsible for killing a controversial proposal to circumvent the debt limit, a senior administration official told BuzzFeed Sunday. On Saturday the Treasury Department released a statement ruling out the only remaining alternative to Congress raising the nation’s borrowing limit, which would utilize a loophole in federal law to mint a $1 trillion coin to be deposited in the Federal Reserve and ensure the federal government could pay all bills and debt obligations.\\n\\nAccording to that Buzzfeed article, the Federal Reserve would have actually refused to recognize the trillion dollar coin if the Obama administration had tried to deposit it with the Fed…\\n\\nBut it was the Federal Reserve that killed the proposal, the official told BuzzFeed, denying a purely political rationale for the announcement, saying the independent central bank would not have credited the Treasury’s accounts for the vast sum for depositing the coin.\\n\\nWow.\\n\\nSo there you go.\\n\\nThe real boss has told Barack Obama how it is going to be, and Obama plans to meekly comply.\\n\\nSo why is the Federal Reserve so adamant about maintaining their monopoly over money creation?\\n\\nWell, it is all about compound interest. Albert Einstein once made the following statement about compound interest…\\n\\n“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it … he who doesn’t … pays it.”\\n\\nWhen the Federal Reserve system was initially created back in 1913, the bankers that created it intended for it to be a perpetual debt machine that would extract massive amounts of wealth from the U.S. government (and ultimately from all of us) through the mechanism of compound interest. Each year, hundreds of billions of dollars of interest are transferred into the pockets of the wealthy bankers and foreign nations that own our debt. This is one of the reasons why I preach about the evils of government debt until I am blue in the face. The debt-based Federal Reserve system is a way to systematically steal the wealth of the United States, and it is happening right in front of our eyes, but very few people actually understand it well enough to complain about it.\\n\\nUnfortunately, we are rapidly getting to the point where we have accumulated so much debt that it is threatening to collapse our entire financial system. The following comes from a recent Zero Hedge article…\\n\\nBy now most are aware of the various metrics exposing the unsustainability of US debt (which at 103% of GDP, it is well above the Reinhart-Rogoff “viability” threshold of 80%; and where a return to just 5% in blended interest means total debt/GDP would double in under a decade all else equal simply thanks to the “magic” of compounding), although there is one that captures perhaps best of all the sad predicament the US self-funding state (where debt is used to fund nearly half of total US spending) finds itself in. It comes from Zhang Monan, researcher at the China Macroeconomic Research Platform: “The US government is now trying to repay old debt by borrowing more; in 2010, average annual debt creation (including debt refinance) moved above $4 trillion, or almost one-quarter of GDP, compared to the pre-crisis average of 8.7% of GDP.” This is a key statistic most forget when they discuss the stock and flow of US debt: because whereas the total US deficit, and thus net debt issuance, is about $1 trillion per year, one has to factor that there is between $3 and $4 trillion in maturities each year, which have to be offset by a matched amount of gross issuance just to keep the stock of debt flat (pre deficit funding). The assumption is that demand for this gross issuance will always exist as old maturities are rolled into new debt, however, this assumption is contingent on one very key variable: interest rates not rising.\\n\\nDo you understand what is being said there?\\n\\nNot only is our debt rising by more than a trillion dollars a year, we also need to roll over trillions of dollars of federal debt each year. If interest rates on that debt start rising, we are going to start feeling the pain very rapidly.\\n\\nAs I have mentioned previously, the average rate of interest on U.S. government debt was 6.638 percent back in 2000. If we returned to that level today, we would be paying more than a trillion dollars a year just in interest on the national debt.\\n\\nThe main thing keeping interest rates low right now is the fact that the U.S. dollar is the de facto reserve currency of the world. If that ends, interest rates on U.S. debt will skyrocket. The following is from a recent article by Chris Ferreira…\\n\\nThe US Dollar is the reserve currency of the world. You need it to buy oil, a vital component of any economy. Since other countries like China cannot print US dollars at their leisure, they have to get it from somewhere. They get it from trade with the US. The US buys products in Asia and the rest of the world with US dollars, and in turn these same dollar surpluses are used to buy oil and US bonds, creating a much needed artificial demand for US dollars. This is also how the enormous US 558$ billion trade deficit in 2011 was financed. The US has been in a trade deficit since the 1980′s and it continues the grow as jobs and manufacturing are being lost to more competitive nations. The trade deficit also accounts for the national debt. The financing of the debt creates artificial demand for US bonds which helps lower the interest rate and coincidentally helps to raise the debt levels even higher.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the rest of the world is starting to move away from the U.S. dollar. Over the past couple of years, a whole host of international currency agreements have been signed that are intended to start reducing the use of the U.S. dollar in international trade. For much more on this, please see the following article: “The Giant Currency Superstorm That Is Coming To The Shores Of America When The Dollar Dies“.\\n\\nMost Americans have absolutely no idea how very close we are to financial catastrophe. The only way we can continue to service our enormous 16 trillion dollar debt is for interest rates on that debt to remain super low. But the only way those interest rates can remain low is for the U.S. dollar to remain absolutely dominant in international trade. Once the rest of the world rejects the U.S. dollar, the game is over.\\n\\nWe are headed for total system meltdown, but neither major political party is going to do a thing about it. They are both just going to continue to meekly comply with the dictates of the real boss of our financial system – the Federal Reserve.\\n\\nIt is imperative that we educate the American people about these things. Please share this article with as many people as you can, and the following is another great article for anyone that does not understand how the Federal Reserve is destroying our financial system: “10 Things That Every American Should Know About The Federal Reserve“.',\n",

       " ('Barack Obama must choose between high unemployment or large fiscal deficits. It’s one or the other. If he chooses to increase government spending and provide a second round of stimulus; unemployment will fall, the output gap will narrow, business confidence will strengthen, and the economy will continue on the path of recovery. If he refuses to provide more stimulus; unemployment will hover around 10 per cent, credit will continue to contract, confidence will flag, and the economy will underperform for years to come. And–surprise, surprise–the deficits will balloon anyway, because household deleveraging is going to continue regardless of what the administration does. That will slow consumer spending and reduce tax revenues which will only add to the budget shortfall. So, it’s not a matter of whether we will have deficits or not. We will, no matter what. The question is whether we’ll suck-it-up and do what needs to be done (by investing in our future and putting people back to work) or follow some monkish austerity program which will only make matters worse.\\n\\nThe media has played a big role in fueling deficit hysteria. It’s all part of a well-funded public relations campaign aimed at putting the government on a starvation diet. The long-term goal is to privatize public assets, crush the labor movement, and dismantle the social safety net. A recent article in CounterPunch by Ellen Brown exposes some of the people behind the “fiscal responsibility” movement and shows that what they really want is to divert Social Security benefits into a “mandatory savings tax” that would be automatically withdrawn from workers paychecks into an “investment pool” that Wall Street bankers would manage. Nice, eh? The banksters would rather skip the niggling task of fleecing their victims themselves and, instead, have the remittances posted directly to their accounts. It’s more efficient that way. Here’s an excerpt from Brown’s article:\\n\\n“When billionaires pledge a billion dollars to educate people to the evils of something, it is always good to peer closely at what they are up to. Hedge fund magnate Peter G. Peterson was formerly Chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations and head of the New York Federal Reserve. He is now senior chairman of Blackstone Group… Peterson is also founder of the Peter Peterson Foundation, which has adopted the cause of imposing “fiscal responsibility” on Congress. He hired David M. Walker, former head of the Government Accounting Office, to spearhead a massive campaign to reduce the runaway federal debt, which the Peterson/Walker team blames on reckless government and consumer spending. The Foundation funded the movie “I.O.U.S.A.” to amass popular support for their cause, which largely revolves around dismantling Social Security and Medicare benefits as a way to cut costs and return to “fiscal responsibility. “\\n\\nTo summarize, deficit hysteria is a hoax concocted by far-right demagogues who are trying to advance their socially-destructive agenda for their own personal gain. Fortunately, the opposition has mounted an impressive counter-attack and refuted many of the spurious claims made by the deficit worrywarts. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has done a particularly good job of educating the public on the issue and analyzing the movement’s supporters. Here’s a clip from his article titled “Fiscal scare Tactics”:\\n\\n“To me …the sudden outbreak of deficit hysteria brings back memories of the groupthink that took hold during the run-up to the Iraq war. Now, as then, dubious allegations, not backed by hard evidence, are being reported as if they have been established beyond a shadow of a doubt. Now, as then, much of the political and media establishments have bought into the notion that we must take drastic action quickly, even though there hasn’t been any new information to justify this sudden urgency. Now, as then, those who challenge the prevailing narrative, no matter how strong their case and no matter how solid their background, are being marginalized. “True, there is a longer-term budget problem. ….But there’s no reason to panic about budget prospects for the next few years, or even for the next decade (because) interest payments on federal debt; according to the projections, a decade from now they’ll have risen to 3.5 percent of G.D.P. How scary is that? It’s about the same as interest costs under the first President Bush. “Thanks to deficit hysteria, Washington now has its priorities all wrong: all the talk is about how to shave a few billion dollars off government spending, while there’s hardly any willingness to tackle mass unemployment. Policy is headed in the wrong direction — and millions of Americans will pay the price.”\\n\\nORDER IT NOW\\n\\nThe basic problem is not hard to grasp; the private sector (us) cannot save unless the public sector (the government) runs a deficit. The surpluses of the Clinton era were produced by private sector deficits. In other words, the buildup of household debt during the late 1990s and early 2000s, (remember all that debt-fueled consumption?) allowed the federal government to run a surplus. Now that the bubble has burst, the process has switched into reverse. Consumers are no longer able to spent at pre-crisis levels because the value of their main assets–their homes and their retirements funds–has dropped precipitously. Thus, households will have to cut back on their spending and either pay-down their debts or set more money aside to repair their balance sheets. The slowdown in spending, along with the reduction in bank lending and consumer credit, will push the economy back into recession unless the government steps up its spending and increases the deficits. So far, Obama’s fiscal stimulus has performed as well as can be expected by reducing the output gap and increasing employment by roughly 2 per cent. But the original stimulus ($787 billion) was not nearly large enough to fill the capital-hole created by the financial meltdown. We need another jolt. Also, the effects of the stimulus will begin to diminish in the second half of 2010. That’s why economists are so concerned, because without additional stimulus, more slack will build-up in the system and a large portion of the workforce will remain jobless.\\n\\nUS households sustained huge losses during the recession; nearly $12 trillion has been slashed from home equity and personal savings in the last two years. Millions of baby boomers, who believed they had sufficient savings for retirement, now must either put off their retirement and work longer, or cut back sharply on spending to pad the nest-egg. The process of deleveraging typically lasts for 6 to 7 years following a financial crisis, according to McKinsey Global Institute. Unfortunately, recent data show that US households have barely begun the process. Their debt-to-disposable income ratio is still extremely high and must return to its historic trend. That means they will not be able to spend as freely as they did before. As private spending slows, businesses will be forced to reduce inventory, lay off workers, and curtail investment. (There’s no need to reinvest when the system is already saturated with overcapacity.) When consumers can’t spend, and businesses have no incentive to invest; the economy nosedives. The government can either boost stimulus to make up for the loss in activity or cut spending and risk another recession.\\n\\nTraditionally, liberals have aligned themselves with progressive economic theory (Keynes) which recommends running large fiscal deficits during downturns. Past experience indicates this is the most effective approach, although the strategy does have its critics. Many of those same critics, however, believe that the United States is at risk of a sovereign default, which is a ridiculous idea that demonstrates a basic lack of understanding about the monetary system. When a nation pays its debts in its own currency, like the US, it can inflate its currency, but not default. This is just more demagoguery from deficit hawks similar to their nonsensical blather about looming hyperinflation. That won’t happen either. In fact, in the short term the biggest danger is disinflation leading to outright deflation. Now that the Fed is winding down its lending facilities and ending quantitative easing (QE) and Obama’s stimulus is dissipating; the signs of contraction are becoming more and more apparent. Consumer credit is shrinking, M3 is dropping, unemployment remains stubbornly high, and core inflation is falling fast (which, in effect, raises real interest rates.)\\n\\nWhat does it all mean? It means the Fed has backed itself into a corner and may have to resume its bond-purchasing program to pump more liquidity into the financial system to avoid a downward spiral. We are not out of the deflationary woods yet. Not by a long-shot.\\n\\nSo we need more stimulus and we need it now. Unfortunately, the deficit hawks have persuaded a narrow majority of the people that, what the economy really needs, is a systemwide debt-purge that will drive down assets prices, increase defaults, and send blood running out into the streets. “Liquidate everything!” Somehow this claptrap has even caught fire with people on the left. It makes the prospect of a double dip recession even more likely.\\n\\nBe careful what you wish for …\\n\\nBut there are pitfalls to budget surpluses as economist Randall Wray points out in his article “The Federal Budget is NOT like a Household Budget” on New Deal 2.0:\\n\\n“The US federal government is 221 years old, if we date its birth to the adoption of the Constitution….With one brief exception, the federal government has been in debt every year since 1776. In January 1835, for the first and only time in U.S. history, the public debt was retired, and a budget surplus was maintained for the next two years in order to accumulate what Treasury Secretary Levi Woodbury called “a fund to meet future deficits.” In 1837 the economy collapsed into a deep depression that drove the budget into deficit, and the federal government has been in debt ever since. Since 1776 there have been exactly seven periods of substantial budget surpluses and significant reduction of the debt. From 1817 to 1821 the national debt fell by 29 per cent; from 1823 to 1836 it was eliminated (Jackson’s efforts); from 1852 to 1857 it fell by 59 per cent, from 1867 to 1873 by 27 per cent, from 1880 to 1893 by more than 50 per cent, and from 1920 to 1930 by about a third. Of course, the last time we ran a budget surplus was during the Clinton years. I do not know any household that has been able to run budget deficits for approximately 190 out of the past 230-odd years, and to accumulate debt virtually nonstop since 1837. “The United States has also experienced six periods of depression. The depressions began in 1819, 1837, 1857, 1873, 1893, and 1929. (Do you see any pattern? Take a look at the dates listed above.) With the exception of the Clinton surpluses, EVERY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF THE OUTSTANDING DEBT HAS BEEN FOLLOWED BY A DEPRESSION, and every depression has been preceded by significant debt reduction….our less serious downturns have almost always been preceded by reductions of federal budget deficits. I don’t know of any case of a national depression caused by a household budget surplus.” (Randall Wray, “The Federal Budget is NOT like a Household Budget: Here’s Why”, New deal 2.0)\\n\\nRepeat: The seven periods of budget surpluses in the US were followed by six Depressions. Will this be the seventh? It depends on whether sanity prevails and Obama pushes another stimulus package through congress. Otherwise, we’re toast.\\n\\nMIKE WHITNEY lives in Washington state and can be reached at fergiewhitney@msn.com',\n",

       " ('Barack Obama must have been very frightened, indeed. Otherwise he never would have inserted himself so forcefully into Greece’s debt crisis. The truth is, there’s much more at stake then people seem to realize. A Greek default would be a major blow to the banking system and the damage would not be limited just to Europe. It could easily spread to the United States and trigger another meltdown. That’s why Obama spent most of his weekend on the phone, exhorting EU finance ministers to take swift action to put out the brushfire. Not surprisingly, the details were omitted in the US media. Here’s an excerpt from the UK Independent explaining what happened behind the scenes last weekend:\\n\\n“As the dust settles and the markets cool, details are beginning to emerge of the frantic background negotiations which generated the €750bn plan to save the euro in the early hours of Monday…..the most startling – and most pivotal role – may have been played by Barack Obama, according to both American and French officials. He convinced the Europeans that it was time not just to Do Something, but to Do Something Very Big, to rescue the euro and prevent the world from plunging into another financial crisis and recession….. “It was after these calls that the headline figure for the EU rescue plan inflated rapidly to €500bn, plus another €250bn from the IMF.” (“Was the euro saved by a call from Barack Obama?”, John Lichfield, Independent)\\n\\nThe Telegraph’s Ambrose Evans-Pritchard tells a similar tale, but with a twist. In this incident, Obama spoke directly to Spanish Premier Jose Luis Zapatero. Here’s an excerpt from the Telegraph:\\n\\n“Premier Jose Luis Zapatero told a stunned nation that public sector pay will be reduced by 5 percent this year and frozen in 2011…Pension rises will be shelved. The country’s €2,500 baby bonus will be canceled. Aid to the regions will be slashed and infrastructure projects will be put on ice…. “US President Barack Obama played a key role behind the scenes, pleading with Mr Zapatero for ‘resolute action’. The telephone call from the White House is a clear indication that contagion from Greece and Portugal to the much larger debt markets of Spain had become a global systemic threat by late last week. “The markets were going in for the kill: the eurozone itself was on the brink of collapse,” said Jose Garcia Zarate from 4Cast.” (“EU imposes wage cuts on Spanish ‘Protectorate”, Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, Telegraph)\\n\\nIs that why Obama was twisting arms all Saturday and Sunday, because he thought the EU might collapse? Does that explain why the Federal Reserve reopened its controversial swap lines with European central banks, providing unlimited short-term loans in dollars for collateral to prop up the euro and exposing the US to tens of billions in potential losses without congressional approval? And is that why ECB chief Jean Claude Trichet reversed his position on monetization and agreed to initiate an EU quantitative easing (QE) program to would buy up government and corporate bonds?\\n\\nWhat’s clear, is that very little of last weekend’s behind-the-scenes maneuvering had anything to do with the problems facing ordinary Greeks, who are merely the victims in this latest bank bailout fiasco.\\n\\nGreece will not escape default, so it’s not in its long-term interests to stick with the euro. That just ensures years of high unemployment, severe cuts to public spending, and neverending recession. A return to the drachma would provide an opportunity to restructure debt and regain fiscal equilibrium via devaluation. It would give Greek exports and tourism a boost by making them instantly cheaper. The fact that the Greek “rescue” and kindred efforts in Spain, Portugal and other tottering economies is designed to bail out bankers and the rich and sock it to ordinary people was well explained on this site last week by Michael Hudson, and also by T.P. Wilkinson on this site this weekend.\\n\\nNo country large or small has managed to close a fiscal gap as large as 10.9 per cent of GDP (which is what Greece is being asked to do.) It’s cruel, especially in an environment where deflation is gradually tightening its grip. Greece needs counter-cyclical fiscal stimulus to get out of the hole its in and to grow its way out of recession. The EU plan implements an anti-Keynesian regimen that is the exact opposite of Obama’s American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) the $787 billion fiscal stimulus package to build aggregate demand and lower unemployment. The EU has no funding mechanism to implement such a plan, so it is prescribing extreme austerity measures instead. It’s stupid, cruel and won’t work, except as a short-term shot for the banks.\\n\\nGreece didn’t create this crisis by itself anyway. It had help from Germany. Germany dictates monetary policy in the EU, which means that it bears much of the responsibility for the deficit-mess in the south. Of course, now that the countries that enriched Berlin (by gobbling up their exports) are flailing about in red ink, German politicians have started lecturing them about the evils of profligate spending. Here’s how Michael Pettis sums it up:\\n\\n“The strong euro and burgeoning liquidity it brought on meant that much of Germany’s trade surplus had to be absorbed within the eurozone, forcing especially southern Europe into high trade deficits. These deficits were dismissed, very foolishly it turns out, and against all historical precedents, as being easily managed as long as the sanctity of the euro was maintained…..\\n\\n“As I see it, domestic German policies, perhaps aimed at absorbing East German unemployment, forced a structural trade surplus. The strong euro, along with the automatic recycling of Germany’s large trade surplus within Europe, ensured the corresponding trade deficits in the rest of Europe – unless Europeans were willing to enact policies that raised unemployment in order to counter the deficits. As long as the ECB refused to raise interest rates, southern Europe had to accept asset bubbles and rapidly rising debt-fueled consumption.\\n\\n“This couldn’t go on forever, or even for very long. Now southern Europe is paying the inevitable price, and of course the moralists are accusing the south of being shiftless and lazy, confusing the automatic balancing mechanisms in the balance of payments with moral weakness.” (“Are you ready for the united States of Germany?”, Michael Pettis, China Financial Markets)\\n\\nOnly a small portion of the nearly-$1 trillion bailout will go to Greece. And, even that pittance comes with strict “belt-tightening” conditions. The bulk of the funds will be held in an structured investment vehicle (SIV) as a way to ward off speculators who smell blood in the water and think they can make a killing by toppling sovereign bond markets in Portugal, Spain and Italy.\\n\\nObama’s concern is that a Greek default will put pressure on French and German banks (which have 110 billion-euro exposure) that will start the dominoes tumbling again. According to Dow Jones, “JP Morgan’s holdings of non-U.S. government bonds increased by $36.5 billion in 2009, while Citigroup’s increased by almost $40 B.” (“The European Bailout”, James Hamilton, Econbrowser)\\n\\nSo, despite the news this week that all four of the nation’s biggest banks (Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Citigroup) racked up perfect quarters off their trading desks, (showing that the Fed’s liquidity and zero-rates has restored profitability) the banking system is still so weak that the President of the United States has to spend his whole weekend hectoring heads-of-state throughout Euroland to beef up their bailout or the whole financial system will come crashing down.\\n\\nWhat does that tell us? It tells us that the whole “recovery” meme is a fraud. It tells us that the banks (where lending is down 20 per cent, and foreclosures are running at 300,000 per month) are once again engaged in the riskiest type of speculation; that they’re using complex financial assets and repo to maximize leverage to goose profits in the middle of a slump. And, it tells us that Obama is Wall Street’s biggest champion, a real “enabler” in chief.\\n\\nGreece should walk away from this farce and start fresh. “Thumbs down” on the EU bailout.\\n\\nMIKE WHITNEY lives in Washington state.

       " ('Barack Obama says that the notion that our laws are not being enforced uniformly is “rooted in reality” and that the rioting in Ferguson will “make for good TV”. Time Magazine says that the Ferguson riots “are part of the American experience” and “are a necessary part of the evolution of society”. Statements such as these stir the pot in Ferguson and provide fuel for the violent protests that have erupted nationwide. And now that protesters are rioting and looting in major cities all over America, all sorts of angry and dissatisfied individuals are coming out of the woodwork. For example, CBS Seattle is reporting that “communists” and “Palestinian groups” have joined the protests in Portland. This kind of civil unrest draws them in like a moth to a flame. But instead of stirring the pot in Ferguson like Obama and the media are doing, real leaders are trying to bring us together. Setting fires and destroying businesses is not going to solve anything.

The gathering draws thousands of people, including nuns and priests, veterans and labor organizers, along with other peace and solidarity activists. They all come for a two-day creative mixture of diverse events that leaves everyone politically transformed and emotionally peaked.\\n\\nThis year’s event was no different. Over the weekend of Nov 19-21, close to 5000 people took part is a series of colorful and dramatic actions. Thirty were arrested and held several days by police. Four of these were arrested after intentionally committing civil disobedience by climbing over a fence topped with barbed wire at the entrance to Fort Benning. Others were arrested for simply straying off a sidewalk in an attempt to march to downtown Columbus, GA. Local courts imposed heavy fines and maximum sentences.\\n\\nWhy is the U.S military training torturers and death squads? The answer is an old one: wealth, power and intimidated, non-union labor.\\n\\n\"For the past several decades, the US has allied with dictators in Latin America who helped that region’s small, elite group of wealthy landowners,\" said SOAW founder Father Roy Bourgeois, a Louisiana native, who lives just outside the gates of the school in Fort Benning where he carries on his work.\\n\\n\"We got involved militarily with these countries because they were rich in natural resources, with coffee in Colombia, bananas in Central America, copper in Chile, petroleum in Venezuela and tin in Bolivia. With their militaries, the U.S. joined with them to exploit those natural resources and to pay workers $1 a day. There were no labor laws there,\" Bourgeois noted. \"We were like the new conquistadors.\"\\n\\nThe high point of the weekend was the Sunday procession of thousands, each carrying a white cross with the name of a slain Latin American peasant, worker or child, and a number of priests and nuns, including Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero, slain by those trained in Fort Benning’s SOA facility. Teams of singers mournfully sang the names and ages, and after each one, everyone raised their crosses, and answered with the classic salute of the living to those who have fallen in battle: \"Presente!\"\\n\\nThe procession lasted for hours as the column of mourners bearing crosses of the dead walked from the front of the stage up one side of the street to the police barriers and back down the other side of the street to the back of the stage. There they placed the crosses into the chain link fence blocking the entrance to the military base. Many mourners cried. Some raised their fists. Some knelt in prayer or meditation as the singing of the names and the chant of \"Presente!\" continued. Behind the stage a theatre group staged a scene of murdered members of a religious order, their bodies spattered with blood. Others snapped pictures or stood quietly.\\n\\nAs soon as a young man approached the fence military loudspeakers surrounding the entire area blared a recorded message asserting that the military base was a legal entity and operated under the U.S. Constitution and that crossing onto base property was a federal crime. Cheering and applause roared up as the young man climbed the fence, crossed the barbed wire top and dropped onto the grass. Before he could reach the second fence he was apprehended and cuffed by the military police. On the east side of the street up the hillside crowds of neighborhood residents stood silently in their yards observing the ceremony of remembrance.\\n\\nOver its 59 years of existence, the SOA, frequently dubbed the \"School of Assassins,\" has left a trail of blood and suffering. It has trained over 60,000 Latin American soldiers in counterinsurgency techniques, sniper training, commando and psychological warfare, military intelligence and interrogation tactics. Among those targeted are educators, union organizers, religious workers, student leaders, and others who work for the rights of the poor. Hundreds of thousands of Latin Americans have been tortured, raped, assassinated, \"disappeared,\" massacred, and forced into being refugees.\\n\\n\"I am a different person, and so is everyone else who confronted this evil,\" said Randy Shannon from Beaver County, PA. \"We walked in a procession singing out the name of each and every one of the thousands of Latin American men, women, and children, mostly working people and their spiritual brothers and sisters. It was a remembrance of their loss and our shame.\"\\n\\nShannon is a national committee member of the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism. Together with Jim Skillman and Steve Wise from Atlanta, along with me, we comprised a team of four who worked the CCDS book and literature table, as well as taking part in many of the events. Randy made the long drive from Pennsylvania the day before, so we were early arrivals on Saturday, Nov. 20. We managed to get our van unloaded and table set up before 9am.\\n\\nThe School of the Americas Watch team had the area well organized. A strikingly decorated stage was constructed near the double barbed wire topped fences blocking the entrance to Fort Benning. The stage was at the foot of a 10-block-long section of a street that was had been blocked off by police. The wide corridor with tall loudspeakers stationed every few blocks, provided excellent acoustics. Homes of local residents were on one side of the corridor, and many had food concessions on their lawns. On the other side of the street was a chain link fence, against which a long line of booths for political groups and vendors were arrayed. On the other side of the chain link fence was a grassy area patrolled by military and local police.\\n\\nBefore long, the buses start arriving. They came from across the South and the Midwest, up to Minnesota, down to Florida, and out to Nebraska. A good number were from small Catholic colleges and universities, and loads of students, along with the nuns, monks and priests who taught them, unloaded with smiles and excitement at being there.\\n\\n\"As an activist since the 1960s,\" said Atlanta’s Jim Skillman, \"I find it intoxicating to be in the midst of so many justice-minded young people.\" A Vietnam veteran, Skillman had joined SDS at Georgia State after leaving the army in 1967, and has been a dedicated labor, peace and human rights organizer ever since.\\n\\nOther veterans started showing up in batches. They gathered around the ‘Courage to Resist’ table, a group of today’s Iraq and Afghan vets. They were featuring a display defending Private Bradley Manning, facing 50 years in prison for being a whistleblower leaking information about war crimes in Iraq.\\n\\nA variety of religious forces also began arrives. A group of Presbyterians unfurled a banner. A group of Buddhist monks of Nipponzan Myohoji, Atlanta Dojo walked more than 100 miles as a walking prayer to ‘Close the SOA.’ They averaged 15 miles per day, staying in churches or supporters\\' homes. .\\n\\nOur CCDS table quickly became very busy. We came up with the successful idea of making a thousand small water-applicable ‘No to SOA’ tattoos, the letters SOA with a red circle and slash. ‘Get a free tattoo! Just sign up with your email for our CCDS newsletter!’ We were surrounded by eager signers for the entire two days. Naturally, some of the taboo applications turned into longer discussions and book purchases. It was a lively time well spent.\\n\\nA far larger feature of the weekend than activity at the tables, however, was an ongoing tension shaping up with the police, military security and the FBI, who are all present in force. The strategy of the SOA and local authorities is apparently to find every possible minor transgression to crack down hard on participants, to impose quick and severe penalties for planned civil disobedience, and where no problems exists, to use undercover agent provocateurs to create division and trouble.\\n\\nThe Columbus city police headed the security preparations this year, assisted by the Muscogee County sheriff’s and marshal’s offices, Fort Benning’s own military police force, and a number of undercover agents disguised as protestors.\\n\\nThe agent provocateurs were focused on a planned march to take the SOA Watch protest into downtown Columbus on Saturday afternoon. At a meeting the night before, three individuals kept egging people into the streets. When challenged as to who they were, they then faded away. The next day when the march did take place, a number of the crowd stepped off the sidewalk and into the street at one point. According to the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer:\\n\\n\"Lauren Stinson, an undercover agent with the Metro Narcotics Task Force, testified Sunday that she participated in two meetings with SOA Watch protesters as they planned to step onto Victory Drive Saturday afternoon. All but one of the 22 arrested were found guilty, an SOA Watch organizer said. Stinson followed the group of about 12 people into the southbound lane around 4:45 p.m., blocking traffic and being rounded up with the others on charges including obstruction of a highway and unlawful assembly. Stinson was put in the back of a patrol car and taken to the Muscogee County Jail, but wasn’t arrested. She testified before Columbus Recorder’s Court Judge Michael Cielinski in some of the 22 cases the judge heard Sunday afternoon.\"\\n\\nWhen defense attorneys tried to question Agent Stinson on the stand to learn more about her team’s operation, the judge ruled that she didn’t have to answer, and she didn’t. For the minor incursion of stepping into the street, each protestor was hit with $5000 in bail and six month jail terms.\\n\\n\"Many of these tactics are not new,\" said Jake Olzen of the SOA Watch team. \"What is new, however, is the intensity, preparation, and specific targeting used by law enforcement authorities to discredit the movement’s legitimacy through the use of scare tactics and deterrence. For example, the Columbus Police department had photographs and lists of members of the SOA Watch Legal Collective and were specifically targeting these individuals because of their capacity as organizers and their ability to offer legal support. Charity Ryerson, a former SOA Prisoner of Conscience and Georgetown University law student, was specifically sought out and arrested for her role as an organizer.\"\\n\\nSunday morning began with a march of about 100 veterans, followed by music from the stage, mixed with appeals for bail money for those arrested the day before.\\n\\nOne visitor to our table on Sunday morning was Bob King, the newly elected president of the United Auto Workers. Randy talked to him about the jobs crisis, and sold him our pamphlet on full employment. King has been at the SOA Watch protest many times, and has led a U.S. trade union delegation to El Salvador. This year he was a featured speaker, and took part in the procession with his daughter.\\n\\n\"The SOA has a terrible history,\" said King from the stage. \"Its graduates were involved in some of the worst human rights abuses in South and Central America including the assassination of Archbishop Romero and six Jesuits priests at the University of Central America in San Salvador. Those of us who have democratic rights must be a voice for those less fortunate who do not have a voice because of the terrorism they face.\"\\n\\nA speaker from Resistencia in Honduras also detailed some of the atrocities carried out by the Micheletti and Lobo regimes since the June 28 coup. The new Wikileaks exposes may well reveal a less-than-neutral hand by the Obama administration.\\n\\nFather Roy Bourgeois, when he spoke from the stage, tied the arrests and undercover police efforts over the weekend to the wider efforts by the FBI to target antiwar and solidarity activists with grand jury subpoenas under the guise of ‘fighting terrorism.’\\n\\n\"If the FBI is interested in investigating terrorism,\" said Father Bourgeois, \"they should come here to Columbus, Georgia, home of Ft. Benning, where there is the School of the Americas. This really is a well known terrorist training camp, and if we want to get serious about talking about terrorism and closing down terrorist training camps, I would highly recommend that the FBI come right in their backyard....I want to offer my support, as so many of us want to, to our brothers and sisters in the Committee to Stop FBI Repression. What has happened to them can happen to anyone, anyone that is a critic of U.S. foreign policy.\"\\n\\nAs the speeches concluded and the procession was underway, the planned civil disobedience of climbing the barbed-wire fence into Ft. Benning got underway. This year four people took that step. Two of them, Louie Vitale, OFM, who crossed the line for the fourth time, and David Omondi, of the Los Angeles Catholic Worker who crossed the line for the first time, pleaded ‘no contest’ and were immediately convicted in federal court. They each received a six month prison sentence from U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephen Hyles. Nancy Smith and Chris Spicer, the two others who crossed over the fence, will go to trial January 5, 2011.\\n\\nA number of reports noted that this year’s SOAW effort was smaller than the peak of 20,000 years back. Part of the reason was that this year\\'s efforts were divided between those who came to Ft Benning, and others who had lobbied Congress earlier this summer. In any case, given the high spirits and determination of those who came this year, the struggle will be ongoing.\\n\\nRandy Shannon summed it up: \"Seeing UAW’s Bob King here and hearing his militant speech pledging labor\\'s solidarity with the peace community and Latin America, all working to close this abomination—that gives me hope. Likewise, the thousands of students from small Catholic colleges across the country standing up against murder and torture--that gives me hope as well.\"\\n\\n[Carl Davidson is a national co-chair and field organizer for the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism, and a webmaster for Beaver County Peace Links.

       " ('Because even if you disagree with them, they\\'re doing you a huge favor. If you\\'re a strong progressive and you think Howard Dean has gone out too far left in health care reform or Jane Hamsher has attacked President Obama too hard form the left -then, fantastic, you are now officially a moderate!\\n\\nAnd more importantly, so is Obama.\\n\\nWhy is this so important? I\\'m not sure you particularly want to be moderate, and I\\'m certainly not sure you are one. But that\\'s not the point. The point is that the mainstream media loves people who they can call \"moderates.\" If Joe Lieberman is somewhere between Obama and Cheney, no matter how far to the right he is, he gets to be called a moderate. Why? Because there\\'s someone to the right of him.\\n\\nNow, you have someone to the left of you. Congratulations, you made it! You\\'re now part of the cool crowd in DC, the only people that the establishment media care about or give any credence to - moderates.\\n\\nI get thrown into the Hamsher category because I believe in attacking hard from the left. Some have started to call this the Uygur Doctrine, which, of course, I love. The reality is I\\'m a political moderate who until about a month ago believed we should stay longer in Afghanistan and that single payer was not the way to go. But it\\'s not my positions that matter as much as my attitude. We have to, have to, have to attack Obama form the left. If we don\\'t, he is seen as the far left and the whole spectrum shifts even further right than it already is.\\n\\nIf Obama is seen as the middle that helps him. So, even if you think Jane is crazy to team up with Grover Norquist and her attacks have no merit (you would be wrong on that by the way), you have to send her a thank you note for making Obama look centrist. Rahm might not be happy about their target, but he has to be happy with how the politics of it plays out for the president.\\n\\nBut much more importantly, this isn\\'t about Obama. This is about moving the spectrum. If there is no real and credible left-wing that fights back, then the entire political landscape gets pushed down to the right. This has huge policy implications, as we just saw in the health care fight.\\n\\nBesides which, what do we have to lose? We lost the public option. We\\'re going to lose on climate change (nearly a foregone conclusion at this point). Financial reform is terribly watered down and getting weaker by the minute. The war in Afghanistan has already been escalated, twice. Do I need to go on? This is what you get when there is no credible threat from the left.\\n\\nWorst case scenario, Dean and Hamsher lose (I understand their tactics are entirely different, and in some ways I hate to lump them in together, but I do because they are among the few making real noise on the left), and they move the spectrum left and make other progressives look moderate. Best case scenario, they win! Dare we dream?\\n\\nI know what some of you are thinking - that\\'s not the worst case scenario. The worst case is somehow their attacks on Obama help Republicans win. But if you buy into that, then you have to pack your bags and go home. That means you are never willing to forcefully challenge Obama out of the fear that it might somehow hurt him. While I\\'m sure he appreciates that, I can guarantee you that he will thank you by completely ignoring you (and your policy priorities). Asking politely is obviously not getting the job done.\\n\\nReal political pressure by definition involves the possibility of real political pain. If you\\'re not willing to go that far, then in my humble opinion you are too risk averse to have any consequential role to play in current day politics. Politics is about power, if you don\\'t ever wield it, then you\\'re not really in the game.\\n\\nThe Young Turks',\n",

But the box? That’s a different story. McDonald’s has given the back of each carton the full-on rainbow treatment. The special boxes will be available at nine locations in the Bay Area during the month of June and are already available in Washington, D.C.\\n\\nMcDonald’s locations along the city’s Pride parade route had the boxes ready to go to commemorate the occasion. “The rainbow fry boxes are a fun way to show our support of the LGBTQ community using one of McDonald’s most iconic and recognizable items; however, these fry boxes are ‘small potatoes’ in the grand scheme of our commitment to this community,” Cathy Martin, co-chair of McDonald’s PRIDE Network, said via a statement.\\n\\nIt’s a major statement from a huge national chain. But McDonald’s isn’t just putting out the boxes for fun — McDonald’s of Greater D.C. and Greater Bay Area are both official Pride sponsors for their respective cities. Putting a rainbow on one of the most iconic menu items is certainly making a statement of solidarity with the LGBTQ community.\\n\\nKim Knapp, a spokesperson for the chain, added, “McDonald’s has always been a company that has supported diversity and inclusion of its employees and extended McDonald’s family. As an official sponsor of this year’s Pride festivities, we looked for a unique way to bring that celebration into our restaurants throughout the Greater Bay Area.”\\n\\nThe rainbow fries may not fall into the category of Technicolor foods, but the bold, bright carton is just as photo-ready as any trendy Instagram food out there.

       " ('Because we all know the end of the Republican Presidency of Herbert Hoover, much like the end of the Republican Presidency of George W. Bush is a period of time that the modern GOP and it\\'s supporters are convinced that their ideas were awesome. The end of the 1920\\'s, like the end of 2007-2008, is not proof of the total failure of GOP no tax no regulation privatization anti spending policies to a Republican. Nope, Hoover wasn\\'t the problem, and FDR and Kenyesian economics made things worse, just the same way you can\\'t blame Bush and his policies but you can sure as hell blame socialism and the liberal President. Republicans, insulated in their sound proof right wing media echo chamber, live in a fantasy world equivalent to the happy place Jim Carrey goes to in Dumb and Dumber when the big bully Seabass of reality shows up to destroy their blissful willful ignorance.\\n\\nThe reason the economy sucks for the lower 98% of Americans is that we have no fucking jobs. There aren\\'t enough jobs available, so there isn\\'t enough income and disposable income available, and income inequality has gotten so drastically bad, wages increases have been stagnant against rising prices for sooo long, the special interests have been robbing us for sooo long we have nothing left. There is no more manufacturing industry in this country to support the working class, we shipped those jobs overseas, and we are busy shipping more jobs overseas while corporations enjoy record profits and the lowest tax rates in generations. Working class people can\\'t buy stuff because more and more of our money is going to booming gas prices and health insurance costs and banks that speculate and drive up the prices of food, gas and everything else, and the Republican answer, as always, is to blame taxes and spending and give every advantage possible to the richest among us in the disproved beliefs that wealth will eventually trickle down and low taxes will somehow increase revenue instead of creating massive deficits. Demand is the problem, and creating that demand by putting money into the hands of consumers is the only way to fix the economy for the average working class American. Cutting vital services is not the answer. Cutting taxes for the rich again as they hoard their wealth in an economic siege against the\\n\\nworking class is not the answer, and yes, defense spending actually does count as spending. But not if you live in your own magical land of make believe where Reagan is John Wayne and FDR was a bad guy.\\n\\nThis is the lizard brain of Sarah Palin on full display when she invents her own history on the spot. She honestly believes it. She doublethinked herself into it being true, and her duckspeak answer is her attempt to vocalize her doublethinking process in a way that you will understand. This is why Jon Kyl looks like an idiot to the rest of us when he says lies and then says that what he said wasn\\'t intended to be taken as a \"factual statement.\" To a modern Conservative today, the real truth is \\'Fuck you, socialist, Planned Parenthood DOES spend 98% of it\\'s funds on abortions!\\' our facts don\\'t match theirs, and thus, must be false. God forbid a Republican who wishes to be taken seriously by the rabid misinformation driven base deviates from the narrative and recognizes the true reality of where things stand, the GOP base LOVES the lies and the narrative, if you admit that an individual mandate is an effective way of providing health care to the public your career is pretty much over if you don\\'t change your history to match what the GOP base wants to believe. Mitt Romney can not rewrite his history. He is screwed. Rewriting history on the fly is integral to being a modern conservative. How can you possibly be against the Civil Rights Act, Medicare, Social Security, Health Care Reform, Wall Street Reform AND Health Care for 9/11 First Responders and for tax cuts for the rich, war and torture, without realizing you\\'re a bit of a Dick? Well, if you are a Conservative, you never have to be wrong again, because being on the wrong side of history doesn\\'t fit in with GOP ideology. To understand the modern Conservative propaganda consumer, you must realize it is always the fault of The Government, Lazy Poor People, Welfare Queens, Illegal Immigrants, Muslim Terrorists, Feminists, Gay people, Women seeking Abortions, taxes, spending, regulations and Liberals. And Black People. They just don\\'t say that last part out loud in public anymore.\\n\\nIf you want the perfect microcosm of the GOP war on reality, all you have to do is look at when Newt Gingrich ended his Presidential aspirations and temporarily excommunicated himself from the inner circle of Republican \\'serious people\\' for saying that the Paul Ryan reverse Robin Hood budget was \"Right Wing Social Engineering\", Then, in a move that stunned balls out liars and sane people everywhere, Newt told the world that anybody who directly quotes video of what Newt Gingrich said, as he said it, is lying to you. Just like Rick James on The Dave Chappelle show, there is this moment where they can tell you something that they would never do, and then admit to doing it, but then just as quickly dismiss it. I never did that. Why would I stomp my feet on their -rights- couch? Yeah, I remember that time I stomped my feet on their -rights- couch. So what?\\n\\nConservatives can say whatever they want, then forget (Example A. John McCain) a moment later. They make their own history up as they go, because at the bottom of everything the GOP and Conservatives stand for is nothing more than a subservience to the unfettered free trade style of governance and economics that was dreamed up by Milton Friedman, glorified by Ayn Rand and then totally collapsed after 30 years of experimentation under George W. Bush. The only thing Conservatives stand for is a jumble of policies that solely exist to transfer massive amounts of wealth from the public sector to the private sector, it all comes down to a massive transfer of wealth from the poor and working class to the very, very rich, and any rights that must be stripped from citizens, consumers and workers will be stripped, anything that can be torn down, privatized and have their prices driven up for the sake of profit will be privatized, love will be hated and hate will be glorified, social justice will be damned and justice in society will be damned. To be a Republican, to be a Conservative begins with the denial of those facts. Republicans are masters of doublethink who speak in duckspeak. Up is Up AND Down, and it only counts if you are a Republican, unless it doesn\\'t count because you are a Republican. So suck on that, hippy, cause I will just invent my own reality. USA! USA!

The first explains, better then I can in the following, how Ryan plans to kill Medicare while getting seniors to support, or at least not fight it. The second explains how Ryan’s plan will provide huge tax cuts for the wealthy now while shifting the burden to the rest of us down the road. Highly recommended reading; http://www.npr.org/... and http://www.bloomberg.com/....\\n\\nTo see the evil beauty of his plan first we need to look at its immediate appeal to a couple critical constituencies, the elderly and the wealthy & powerful.\\n\\nThe elderly made up over 34% of the electorate in 2010 and they will come out strong against anything that threatens their Medicare. Accordingly Ryan’s plan will protect Medicare as it is for everyone over 55. The elderly are protected and the wealthy won’t have to worry about funding Medicare in the future. Genius.\\n\\nThe wealthy would see near immediate cuts in their top tax rates from 35% to 25%. This would be offset a later time by the elimination of tax breaks, to be developed in the future by the Republican controlled House Ways & Means committee.\\n\\nThe above two facets will give the Ryan plan massive advertising support (propaganda), thanks to the Citizens United decision, while stifling the opposition that would have come from the elderly had they not been protected. Genius.\\n\\nOn it’s face this looks like a no brainer, immediate gratification without immediate pain. A harmless, sheep like plan.\\n\\nIn the future however, comes the evil wolf. Medicare is terminated, replaced by $15,000 vouchers that would be used to by private insurance. Of course this will be much cheaper for the government but the vouchers will be totally insufficient for the majority of us who will have to dig into our retirement savings to make up the difference. At the same time the future eliminated tax breaks will fall, not on the wealthy, but overwhelmingly on the rest of us. The tax breaks the republicans have already identified as subject to elimination include items such the mortgage interest deduction the employer provided health insurance deduction and other items that serve to “broaden the base”.\\n\\nLike I said, Ryan’s plan is genius. It provides a possible and politically plausible path to passage of a future tax structure that will massively benefit the wealthy & powerful while screwing the rest of us.

       " ('Being rich is great. But being rich in America? That’s even better.\\n\\nWith US stock benchmarks trading just below record highs, and Treasury yields not too far from the all-time lows reached last summer, the gulf between the world’s wealthy elite – those 18 million households worldwide with more than $1 million in assets – and everybody else is rapidly widening.\\n\\nAccording to a new study by Boston Consulting Group via Bloomberg, these households - with a total head count of roughly 70 million people, or about 1% of the world’s population - control 45 percent of the $166.5 trillion in wealth. By 2021, they will control more than half, suggesting that, while wealth inequality in the rest of the world is simply accelerating, in America, it’s gone into overdrive. Right now, 63 percent of America’s private wealth in the hands of U.S. millionaires and billionaires, BCG said. By 2021, their share of the nation’s wealth will rise to an estimated 70 percent.\\n\\n“The share of income going to the top 1 percent in the U.S. has more than doubled in the last 35 years, after dropping in the decades after World War II (when the rich were taxed at high double-digit rates). The tide shifted in the 1980s under Republican President Ronald Reagan, a decade when “trickle-down economics” saw tax rates for the rich fall, union membership shrink, and stock markets spike.”\\n\\nIn its report, BCG puts the global rate of wealth creation in 2015 and 2016 at 5.3 percent, though the consulting firm expects it to accelerate to about 6 percent annually for the next five years. Those gains will accrue almost exclusively to the wealthiest Americans, while wealth held by everyone else is just barely growing.\\n\\nOf course, there’s a caveat: In America, most of these gains exist only on paper. More than 70% of new wealth creation is derived from the rising value of rich investors’ portfolios. The rest is what BGC describes as “new wealth creation” aka real money earned by workers and entrepreneurs. Globally, the share derived from asset valuations falls to about 50%.\\n\\n“In the U.S., the creation of “new” wealth is a minor factor, making up just 28 percent of the nation’s wealth increase last year. It’s even lower in Japan, at 21 percent. In the rest of the Asia Pacific region, meanwhile, two-thirds of the rise is driven by new wealth creation.”\\n\\nThe richest Americans could receive an additional bump if/when President Donald Trump pushes the fiscal agenda on which he campaigned through Congress – an agenda that includes tax cuts, deregulation and trillions of dollars’ worth of new infrastructure projects. However, since the exact details of these policies are not yet widely known, it’s difficult to predict their specific impact, BCG says.\\n\\n“’No one knows’ what kind of tax changes will become law, said BCG senior partner Bruce Holley. However, “this could buoy the [growth in U.S. wealth] that we are predicting.”\\n\\nAmerica remains home to the highest concentration of millionaires and billionaires in the world, and their ranks are growing fast: Today, about 7 million Americans are worth more than $1 million. BCG expects that number to balloon to 10.4 million by 2021 - an annual growth rate of 8 percent, or about 670,000 new millionaires each year.\\n\\nChina has the second most millionaires and billionaires, at 2.1 million, though its population is four times the size of the US.\\n\\nWithin the US, glaring disparities exist from region to region. As Fortune reported back in 2015, roughly two-thirds of America’s millionaires and billionaires live in 12 metro areas, mostly wealthy enclaves along the coasts.\\n\\nMeanwhile, according to the Federal Reserve’s latest survey of household economics and decisionmaking, a quarter of American adults can’t pay all their monthly bills, and 44% have less than $400 cash on hand in case of an emergency.',\n",

He broke with organized Jewry after the Judeo-Communist victory of 1945, and spent the remainder of his life and the great preponderance of his considerable fortune, at least 2.5 million dollars, exposing the Jewish tyranny which has enveloped the United States.\\n\\nMr. Freedman knew what he was talking about because he had been an insider at the highest levels of Jewish organizations and Jewish machinations to gain power over our nation.

       " ('Berta Caceres\\n\\nBerta Cáceres, Honduras\\n\\nCáceres, a Lenca Indian, co-founded the Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras, known as COPINH, in 2006 to fight the giant hydroelectric dams being built to power the growing extraction of minerals in Honduras. Nearly 30 percent of the nation\\'s land is set aside for mining concessions and the government has approved hundreds of dams.\\n\\nOne of these was the Agua Zarca Dam, a joint project of the Honduran company Desarrollos Energéticos SA (DESA) and the Chinese state-owned Sinohydro, the world’s largest dam developer. Nobody consulted the Lenca even though Agua Zarca would have cut off the supply of water, food and medicine to hundreds of Lenca familes.\\n\\nCOPINH objected and brought the case to the Inter-American Human Rights Commission, appealing against the funder of the dam, the International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank. The group also engaged in civil disobedience to stop construction. In April two years ago, Cáceres led a road blockade to prevent DESA’s access to the dam site. More than a year later, the Lenca people were still at the blockade, braving attacks by private security contractors and the Honduran armed forces. The dam builders finally gave up and pulled out of the project.\\n\\nHoward Wood, Scotland\\n\\n\\n\\nHoward Wood\\n\\n\"The work of Coast goes back to before 1995, when we could see that the seabed around Arran was being basically dredged away. We wanted to have a trial area to find out what happens when you close a small area to all fishing. It took us years to get there, but we did get there in 2008.\"\\n\\nWood led a community-based campaign to set up a Marine Protected Area, for the first time giving Scottish citizens a voice where previously the commercial fishing industry held sway. He was one of the founders of the Community of Arran Seabed Trust (Coast), which campaigned for Scotland\\'s first \"no take\" zone. It bars fishing from part of Arran island\\'s Lamlash Bay.Coast promotes creeling, hand diving for scallops and angling, all part of an effort to maintain sustainable fishing methods. It also has lobbied the Scottish government to tighten restrictions in the Marine Protected Area.\\n\\nThe no-take zone has helped the seabed to regenerate. The BBC reports that a study has shown an increase in the size of adult scallops and the number of juveniles in the no-take area.\\n\\nMarilyn Baptiste, Canada\\n\\n\\n\\nMarilyn Baptiste\\n\\n\"So many times, people always said that, \\'You\\'ll never win against something like this, it\\'s huge,\\'\" Baptiste told Daybreak Kamloops. \"I did realize that. I said that to myself that this is pretty huge, you know, but you know what? This is our territory and we have never given up our land and our title. Never.\"\\n\\nBaptiste is the former chief and now councilor of the Xeni Gwet’in people, one of the divisions of Canada\\'s Tsilhqot\\'in First Nations. She organized her community to defeat a proposal to develop New Prosperity Mine, a giant gold and copper operation in British Columbia. The mine would have been the end of Fish Lake—Teztan Biny—which is crucial to both the economic and spiritual life of the Xeni Gwet’in.The federal government rejected the mine after an environmental review in 2010. But the mining company, Taseko Mines, revised its application the next year. That\\'s when Baptiste began what broadcaster CBC called a one-woman blockade to keep construction crews away from the proposed mining site. The government rejected Taseko\\'s revised plan in last year. Soon afterward, the Supreme Court of Canada granted the Tsilqot\\'in Nation title to more than 656 square miles of in the Nemiah Valley, where Baptiste lives.\\n\\nJean Weiner, Haiti\\n\\n\\n\\nJean Weiner\\n\\nWeiner led community moves to establish Haiti\\'s first Marine Protected Areas with special emphasis on sustainably fishing, managing the diverse marine life and protecting and replanting mangrove forests.\\n\\nNo small feat in the poorest nation in the western hemisphere where environmental concerns are a tough sell si ce 80 percent of Haitians are poverty-stricken. But the environment on the island nation is nearly as impoverished as the people. Just one percent of the original forest cover remains. Over-fishing, destruction of the mangroves and the development of salt pans have damaged the coastal and marine ecosystems.\\n\\nWiener has spent two decades addressing these issues through his non-governmental organization, the FoProBim. His approach is to educate Haitians about the environment, teach conflict resolution, and help them develop sustainable livelihoods. He relentlessly pushes government to monitor, manage and protect the environment.\\n\\n',\n",

       " ('Bill Clinton\\'s prepared remarks, which he\\'s delivering now at the Democratic convention:\\n\\nWe\\'re here to nominate a President, and I\\'ve got one in mind.\\n\\nI want to nominate a man whose own life has known its fair share of adversity and uncertainty. A man who ran for President to change the course of an already weak economy and then just six weeks before the election, saw it suffer the biggest collapse since the Great Depression. A man who stopped the slide into depression and put us on the long road to recovery, knowing all the while that no matter how many jobs were created and saved, there were still millions more waiting, trying to feed their children and keep their hopes alive.\\n\\nI want to nominate a man cool on the outside but burning for America on the inside. A man who believes we can build a new American Dream economy driven by innovation and creativity, education and cooperation. A man who had the good sense to marry Michelle Obama.\\n\\nI want Barack Obama to be the next President of the United States and I proudly nominate him as the standard bearer of the Democratic Party.\\n\\nIn Tampa, we heard a lot of talk about how the President and the Democrats don\\'t believe in free enterprise and individual initiative, how we want everyone to be dependent on the government, how bad we are for the economy.\\n\\nThe Republican narrative is that all of us who amount to anything are completely self-made. One of our greatest Democratic Chairmen, Bob Strauss, used to say that every politician wants you to believe he was born in a log cabin he built himself, but it ain\\'t so.\\n\\nWe Democrats think the country works better with a strong middle class, real opportunities for poor people to work their way into it and a relentless focus on the future, with business and government working together to promote growth and broadly shared prosperity. We think \"we\\'re all in this together\" is a better philosophy than \"you\\'re on your own.\"\\n\\nWho\\'s right? Well since 1961, the Republicans have held the White House 28 years, the Democrats 24. In those 52 years, our economy produced 66 million private sector jobs. What\\'s the jobs score? Republicans 24 million, Democrats 42 million!\\n\\nIt turns out that advancing equal opportunity and economic empowerment is both morally right and good economics, because discrimination, poverty and ignorance restrict growth, while investments in education, infrastructure and scientific and technological research increase it, creating more good jobs and new wealth for all of us.\\n\\nThough I often disagree with Republicans, I never learned to hate them the way the far right that now controls their party seems to hate President Obama and the Democrats. After all, President Eisenhower sent federal troops to my home state to integrate Little Rock Central High and built the interstate highway system. And as governor, I worked with President Reagan on welfare reform and with President George H.W. Bush on national education goals. I am grateful to President George W. Bush for PEPFAR, which is saving the lives of millions of people in poor countries and to both Presidents Bush for the work we\\'ve done together after the South Asia tsunami, Hurricane Katrina and the Haitian earthquake.\\n\\nThrough my foundation, in America and around the world, I work with Democrats, Republicans and Independents who are focused on solving problems and seizing opportunities, not fighting each other.\\n\\nWhen times are tough, constant conflict may be good politics but in the real world, cooperation works better. After all, nobody\\'s right all the time, and a broken clock is right twice a day. All of us are destined to live our lives between those two extremes. Unfortunately, the faction that now dominates the Republican Party doesn\\'t see it that way. They think government is the enemy, and compromise is weakness.\\n\\nOne of the main reasons America should re-elect President Obama is that he is still committed to cooperation. He appointed Republican Secretaries of Defense, the Army and Transportation. He appointed a Vice President who ran against him in 2008, and trusted him to oversee the successful end of the war in Iraq and the implementation of the recovery act. And Joe Biden did a great job with both. He appointed Cabinet members who supported Hillary in the primaries. Heck, he even appointed Hillary! I\\'m so proud of her and grateful to our entire national security team for all they\\'ve done to make us safer and stronger and to build a world with more partners and fewer enemies. I\\'m also grateful to the young men and women who serve our country in the military and to Michelle Obama and Jill Biden for supporting military families when their loved ones are overseas and for helping our veterans, when they come home bearing the wounds of war, or needing help with education, housing, and jobs.\\n\\nPresident Obama\\'s record on national security is a tribute to his strength, and judgment, and to his preference for inclusion and partnership over partisanship.\\n\\nHe also tried to work with Congressional Republicans on Health Care, debt reduction, and jobs, but that didn\\'t work out so well. Probably because, as the Senate Republican leader, in a remarkable moment of candor, said two years before the election, their number one priority was not to put America back to work, but to put President Obama out of work.\\n\\nSenator, I hate to break it to you, but we\\'re going to keep President Obama on the job!\\n\\nIn Tampa, the Republican argument against the President\\'s re-election was pretty simple: we left him a total mess, he hasn\\'t cleaned it up fast enough, so fire him and put us back in.\\n\\nIn order to look like an acceptable alternative to President Obama, they couldn\\'t say much about the ideas they have offered over the last two years. You see they want to go back to the same old policies that got us into trouble in the first place: to cut taxes for high income Americans even more than President Bush did; to get rid of those pesky financial regulations designed to prevent another crash and prohibit future bailouts; to increase defense spending two trillion dollars more than the Pentagon has requested without saying what they\\'ll spend the money on; to make enormous cuts in the rest of the budget, especially programs that help the middle class and poor kids. As another President once said – there they go again.\\n\\nI like the argument for President Obama\\'s re-election a lot better. He inherited a deeply damaged economy, put a floor under the crash, began the long hard road to recovery, and laid the foundation for a modern, more well-balanced economy that will produce millions of good new jobs, vibrant new businesses, and lots of new wealth for the innovators.\\n\\nAre we where we want to be? No. Is the President satisfied? No. Are we better off than we were when he took office, with an economy in free fall, losing 750,000 jobs a month. The answer is YES.\\n\\nI understand the challenge we face. I know many Americans are still angry and frustrated with the economy. Though employment is growing, banks are beginning to lend and even housing prices are picking up a bit, too many people don\\'t feel it.\\n\\nI experienced the same thing in 1994 and early 1995. Our policies were working and the economy was growing but most people didn\\'t feel it yet. By 1996, the economy was roaring, halfway through the longest peacetime expansion in American history.\\n\\nPresident Obama started with a much weaker economy than I did. No President – not me or any of my predecessors could have repaired all the damage in just four years. But conditions are improving and if you\\'ll renew the President\\'s contract you will feel it.\\n\\nI believe that with all my heart.\\n\\nPresident Obama\\'s approach embodies the values, the ideas, and the direction America must take to build a 21st century version of the American Dream in a nation of shared opportunities, shared prosperity and shared responsibilities.\\n\\nSo back to the story. In 2010, as the President\\'s recovery program kicked in, the job losses stopped and things began to turn around.\\n\\nThe Recovery Act saved and created millions of jobs and cut taxes for 95% of the American people. In the last 29 months the economy has produced about 4.5 million private sector jobs. But last year, the Republicans blocked the President\\'s jobs plan costing the economy more than a million new jobs. So here\\'s another jobs score: President Obama plus 4.5 million, Congressional Republicans zero.\\n\\nOver that same period, more than more than 500,000 manufacturing jobs have been created under President Obama – the first time manufacturing jobs have increased since the 1990s.\\n\\nThe auto industry restructuring worked. It saved more than a million jobs, not just at GM, Chrysler and their dealerships, but in auto parts manufacturing all over the country. That\\'s why even auto-makers that weren\\'t part of the deal supported it. They needed to save the suppliers too. Like I said, we\\'re all in this together.\\n\\nNow there are 250,000 more people working in the auto industry than the day the companies were restructured. Governor Romney opposed the plan to save GM and Chrysler. So here\\'s another jobs score: Obama two hundred and fifty thousand, Romney, zero.\\n\\nThe agreement the administration made with management, labor and environmental groups to double car mileage over the next few years is another good deal: it will cut your gas bill in half, make us more energy independent, cut greenhouse gas emissions, and add another 500,000 good jobs.\\n\\nPresident Obama\\'s \"all of the above\" energy plan is helping too – the boom in oil and gas production combined with greater energy efficiency has driven oil imports to a near 20 year low and natural gas production to an all time high. Renewable energy production has also doubled.\\n\\nWe do need more new jobs, lots of them, but there are already more than three million jobs open and unfilled in America today, mostly because the applicants don\\'t have the required skills. We have to prepare more Americans for the new jobs that are being created in a world fueled by new technology. That\\'s why investments in our people are more important than ever. The President has supported community colleges and employers in working together to train people for open jobs in their communities. And, after a decade in which exploding college costs have increased the drop-out rate so much that we\\'ve fallen to 16th in the world in the percentage of our young adults with college degrees, his student loan reform lowers the cost of federal student loans and even more important, gives students the right to repay the loans as a fixed percentage of their incomes for up to 20 years. That means no one will have to drop-out of college for fear they can\\'t repay their debt, and no one will have to turn down a job, as a teacher, a police officer or a small town doctor because it doesn\\'t pay enough to make the debt payments. This will change the future for young Americans.\\n\\nI know we\\'re better off because President Obama made these decisions.\\n\\nThat brings me to health care.\\n\\nThe Republicans call it Obamacare and say it\\'s a government takeover of health care that they\\'ll repeal. Are they right? Let\\'s look at what\\'s happened so far. Individuals and businesses have secured more than a billion dollars in refunds from their insurance premiums because the new law requires 80% to 85% of your premiums to be spent on health care, not profits or promotion. Other insurance companies have lowered their rates to meet the requirement. More than 3 million young people between 19 and 25 are insured for the first time because their parents can now carry them on family policies. Millions of seniors are receiving preventive care including breast cancer screenings and tests for heart problems. Soon the insurance companies, not the government, will have millions of new customers many of them middle class people with pre-existing conditions. And for the last two years, health care spending has grown under 4%, for the first time in 50 years.\\n\\nSo are we all better off because President Obama fought for it and passed it? You bet we are.\\n\\nThere were two other attacks on the President in Tampa that deserve an answer. Both Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan attacked the President for allegedly robbing Medicare of 716 billion dollars. Here\\'s what really happened. There were no cuts to benefits. None. What the President did was save money by cutting unwarranted subsidies to providers and insurance companies that weren\\'t making people any healthier. He used the saving to close the donut hole in the Medicare drug program, and to add eight years to the life of the Medicare Trust Fund. It\\'s now solvent until 2024. So President Obama and the Democrats didn\\'t weaken Medicare, they strengthened it.\\n\\nWhen Congressman Ryan looked into the TV camera and attacked President Obama\\'s \"biggest coldest power play\" in raiding Medicare, I didn\\'t know whether to laugh or cry. You see, that 716 billion dollars is exactly the same amount of Medicare savings Congressman Ryan had in his own budget.\\n\\nAt least on this one, Governor Romney\\'s been consistent. He wants to repeal the savings and give the money back to the insurance companies, re-open the donut hole and force seniors to pay more for drugs, and reduce the life of the Medicare Trust Fund by eight years. So now if he\\'s elected and does what he promised Medicare will go broke by 2016. If that happens, you won\\'t have to wait until their voucher program to begins in 2023 to see the end Medicare as we know it.\\n\\nBut it gets worse. They also want to block grant Medicaid and cut it by a third over the coming decade. Of course, that will hurt poor kids, but that\\'s not all. Almost two-thirds of Medicaid is spent on nursing home care for seniors and on people with disabilities, including kids from middle class families, with special needs like, Downs syndrome or Autism. I don\\'t know how those families are going to deal with it. We can\\'t let it happen\\n\\nNow let\\'s look at the Republican charge that President Obama wants to weaken the work requirements in the welfare reform bill I signed that moved millions of people from welfare to work.\\n\\nHere\\'s what happened. When some Republican governors asked to try new ways to put people on welfare back to work, the Obama Administration said they would only do it if they had a credible plan to increase employment by 20%. You hear that? More work. So the claim that President Obama weakened welfare reform\\'s work requirement is just not true. But they keep running ads on it. As their campaign pollster said \"we\\'re not going to let our campaign be dictated by fact checkers.\" Now that is true. I couldn\\'t have said it better myself – I just hope you remember that every time you see the ad.\\n\\nLet\\'s talk about the debt. We have to deal with it or it will deal with us. President Obama has offered a plan with 4 trillion dollars in debt reduction over a decade, with two and a half dollars of spending reductions for every one dollar of revenue increases, and tight controls on future spending. It\\'s the kind of balanced approach proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission.\\n\\nI think the President\\'s plan is better than the Romney plan, because the Romney plan fails the first test of fiscal responsibility: The numbers don\\'t add up.\\n\\nIt\\'s supposed to be a debt reduction plan but it begins with five trillion dollars in tax cuts over a ten-year period. That makes the debt hole bigger before they even start to dig out. They say they\\'ll make it up by eliminating loopholes in the tax code. When you ask \"which loopholes and how much?,\" they say \"See me after the election on that.\"\\n\\nPeople ask me all the time how we delivered four surplus budgets. What new ideas did we bring? I always give a one-word answer: arithmetic. If they stay with a 5 trillion dollar tax cut in a debt reduction plan – the – arithmetic tells us that one of three things will happen: 1) they\\'ll have to eliminate so many deductions like the ones for home mortgages and charitable giving that middle class families will see their tax bill go up two thousand dollars year while people making over 3 million dollars a year get will still get a 250,000 dollar tax cut; or 2) they\\'ll have to cut so much spending that they\\'ll obliterate the budget for our national parks, for ensuring clean air, clean water, safe food, safe air travel; or they\\'ll cut way back on Pell Grants, college loans, early childhood education and other programs that help middle class families and poor children, not to mention cutting investments in roads, bridges, science, technology and medical research; or 3) they\\'ll do what they\\'ve been doing for thirty plus years now – cut taxes more than they cut spending, explode the debt, and weaken the economy. Remember, Republican economic policies quadrupled the debt before I took office and doubled it after I left. We simply can\\'t afford to double-down on trickle-down.\\n\\nPresident Obama\\'s plan cuts the debt, honors our values, and brightens the future for our children, our families and our nation.\\n\\nMy fellow Americans, you have to decide what kind of country you want to live in. If you want a you\\'re on your own, winner take all society you should support the Republican ticket. If you want a country of shared opportunities and shared responsibilities – a \"we\\'re all in it together\" society, you should vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden. If you want every American to vote and you think its wrong to change voting procedures just to reduce the turnout of younger, poorer, minority and disabled voters, you should support Barack Obama. If you think the President was right to open the doors of American opportunity to young immigrants brought here as children who want to go to college or serve in the military, you should vote for Barack Obama. If you want a future of shared prosperity, where the middle class is growing and poverty is declining, where the American Dream is alive and well, and where the United States remains the leading force for peace and prosperity in a highly competitive world, you should vote for Barack Obama.\\n\\nI love our country – and I know we\\'re coming back. For more than 200 years, through every crisis, we\\'ve always come out stronger than we went in. And we will again as long as we do it together. We champion the cause for which our founders pledged their lives, their fortunes, their sacred honor – to form a more perfect union.\\n\\nIf that\\'s what you believe, if that\\'s what you want, we have to re-elect President Barack Obama.\\n\\nGod Bless You – God Bless America.',\n",

       " ('Bill Denying U.S. Aid to Nations that Won’t Repatriate Alien Criminals Could Have Saved Woman\\n\\nHeadline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!\\n\\nAn imperative bill that aims to withhold American aid to countries that refuse to take back citizens who commit crimes while living—often illegally—in the U.S. is floating around in Congress. Incredibly, the U.S. doles out tens of billions of dollars in foreign aid annually yet some recipients of Uncle Sam’s generosity boldly reject federal efforts to repatriate their most deplorable nationals.\\n\\nThis presents a critical problem for the U.S. and its law-abiding citizens because even the most serious felons get released from prison after serving their sentence. When federal authorities try to deport the alien convicts and officials in their homeland decline, the foreign criminals simply get released into American society. This may sound inconceivable but it happens regularly and, predictably, the recidivism rate is alarmingly high. Federal authorities claim their hands are tied when they can’t remove an alien criminal because they’re not allowed to detain them indefinitely.\\n\\nHere’s an example of the consequences of this absurd system that scatters criminals into communities throughout the nation. An illegal immigrant from Haiti who stabbed a young Connecticut woman to death after completing a 15-year sentence for murder couldn’t be deported by the U.S. government because his island nation wouldn’t take him back—three times! Federal authorities released him and didn’t even bother tracking his whereabouts allowing the con, Jean Jacques, to commit yet another heinous crime. Six months after being released Jacques stabbed 25-year-old Casey Chadwick to death in Norwich, a Connecticut city of about 40,000 residents. It’s important to mention that Connecticut has long protected illegal immigrants with sanctuary policies and even offers them special drivers’ licenses, but the gruesome crime ignited fury and the state’s congressional delegation—all Democrats and avid defenders of sanctuary measures—demanded a federal investigation into the matter.\\n\\nHaiti, a famously impoverished Caribbean country, gets a boatload of money every year from American taxpayers regardless of who occupies the White House. In fact, since the 2010 earthquake the U.S. government has committed $4.2 billion in assistance in addition to the regular flow of cash that Americans give the island nation. The new measure, introduced this year by Texas Congressman Brian Babin, would certainly have made a difference in the Jacques case, though it’s outrageous by any account that Haiti calls the shots in such a critical matter. “There is absolutely no reason that criminal aliens should be released back onto America’s streets, yet that is exactly what is happening by the thousands each and every year because their countries of origin refuse to take them back,” Babin said in a statement announcing his measure.\\n\\nThe proposed bill (Criminal Alien Deportation Enforcement Act of 2017) upholds the rule of law, the congressman says, and holds these countries accountable by stripping their foreign aid and travel visas if they fail to cooperate. Besides withholding money to uncooperative countries that refuse to take back their criminal alien nationals, the measure includes a mandate that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) submit to Congress a report every three months listing those nations. It also provides the victims of crimes committed by criminal aliens standing in federal court to sue for deportation of such criminal aliens. The congressman mentions Casey Chadwick, the 25-year-old stabbing victim, in his statement.\\n\\nA federal report, issued by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is also cited by the lawmaker to make a case for his bill. It discloses that 86,288 illegal immigrants who committed 231,074 crimes were released by the Obama administration since 2013. Among them was Jacques, who was listed as a passenger on three Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) flights to Haiti but instead was set free to butcher an innocent young woman.\\n\\nThe post Bill Denying U.S. Aid to Nations that Won’t Repatriate Alien Criminals Could Have Saved Woman appeared first on Judicial Watch.\\n\\nSource: https://www.judicialwatch.org/blog/2017/01/bill-denying-u-s-aid-nations-wont-repatriate-alien-criminals-saved-woman/',\n",

       " ('Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and other major cryptocurrencies have been on a wild ride this year, and over the past 10 days the volatility that we have witnessed in the marketplace has been absolutely breathtaking. On December 17th, Bitcoin shot above $19,800 for a brief moment before it started plummeting dramatically. At one point the price of Bitcoin dipped below $11,000, which represented close to a 45 percent decline from the record high that it had hit just five days earlier. And Bitcoin was far from alone – virtually every other major cryptocurrency was also down between 25 and 50 percent during that five day period. But now almost all of them are bouncing back, and at this moment the price of Bitcoin is $14,219.99.\\n\\nSo where do things go from here?\\n\\nThere are many that believe that in the short-term the price of Bitcoin will fall back toward the actual cost of production. It has been estimated that the cost to produce a new Bitcoin is currently between three and four thousand dollars, and with the price of Bitcoin so high there is a tremendous incentive for Bitcoin miners to produce as many as possible right now.\\n\\nBut there are others that are convinced that Bitcoin could eventually go to zero…\\n\\nMorgan Stanley analyst James Faucette and his team sent a research note to clients a few days ago suggesting that the real value of bitcoin might be … $0. That’s zero dollars. (Bitcoin stood at around $14,400 at the time of writing.)\\n\\nTo back up his assessment, Faucette made the following arguments…\\n\\n• Can Bitcoin be valued like a currency? No. There is no interest rate associated with Bitcoin.\\n\\n• Like digital gold? Maybe. Does not have any intrinsic use like gold has in electronics or jewelry. But investors appear to be ascribing some value to it.\\n\\n• Is it a payment network? Yes but it is tough to scale and does not charge a transaction fee.\\n\\nFaucette also pointed out that the number of online retailers that accept Bitcoin is actually falling. Five of the top 500 e-commerce merchants accepted Bitcoin during the first quarter of 2016, but now only three still do.\\n\\nIn order for Bitcoin to have a sustainable long-term future, it must become a real currency that is widely used, but many would argue that it is already being surpassed by better and newer options. In fact, one top cryptocurrency expert recent stated that the old Bitcoin network “is as good as unusable”…\\n\\nEmil Oldenburg, the co-founder of Bitcoin.com – one of the world’s largest sites devoted to the cryptocurrency – recently called the cryptocurrency the “most risky investment you can make,” after he switched to bitcoin cash, which he considers to be the future. “The old bitcoin network is as good as unusable,” said in an interview with Swedish tech site Breakit.\\n\\nThat certainly doesn’t sound promising, but so far that hasn’t stopped the price of Bitcoin from heading into the stratosphere. So far in 2017 the price of Bitcoin has risen more than 1,400%, and that number is extremely impressive no matter how you look at it.\\n\\nOf course virtually all of that “digital wealth” could disappear in just a matter of days during a major crash. The CEO of Patriarch Equity, Eric Schiffer, believers that Bitcoin investments are eventually heading for “a thermonuclear death”…\\n\\n“I think bitcoin is a ‘tower of death,’” Schiffer says. “It is going to result in the imminent death of your investment – a thermonuclear death. “Right now we are looking at a financial bubble that is bigger than the tulip craze and I believe that we are headed for a bitcoin crash that will supersede any financial worries of the 21st century,” he added. “People are going to be shocked when they try to liquify their bitcoins.”\\n\\nSchiffer might be right.\\n\\nAfter all, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies don’t have any intrinsic value. Essentially, they are nothing more than digital creations that only have value because people think they have value.\\n\\nBut those that got in back at the beginning and have cashed out now have made enormous amounts of money, and nobody can deny that.\\n\\nWith every form of “investing”, they are winners and there are losers. Unfortunately, those that chose to jump in at the height of the madness could end up losing very big. The following comes from Wolf Richter…\\n\\nBetting on cryptos is a peculiar form of online gambling on a global scale that requires a consensus among participants that they only buy, and that you cannot ever cash out, and now that some folks are trying to cash out, the bets for everyone else are souring. The same dynamics that pushed prices up have reversed and are causing them to crash.\\n\\nBut what if the naysayers are wrong?\\n\\nWhat if this current “Bitcoin crash” is just a bump in the road on the way to $40,000?\\n\\nYears ago, the price of Bitcoin crashed 75 percent at one point. What would have happened if the early investors had all bailed out then instead of holding on until now?\\n\\nThose that sold Bitcoin at $12,000 might end up really kicking themselves if the price of Bitcoin does hit $40,000 by the end of next year, and that is exactly what some top experts are projecting…\\n\\nBillionaire investors and highly respected analysts including hedge fund investor Mike Novogratz, prominent financial analyst Max Keiser, and Fundstrat’s Tom Lee stated that the price of bitcoin will likely surpass the $40,000 margin by the end of 2018, and achieve a $1 trillion market cap.\\n\\nAnd let us not forget that big names such as John McAfee and James Altucher are predicting that the price of Bitcoin will eventually reach one million dollars.\\n\\nTo me, this is absolutely fascinating. On the one side, you have financial experts that believe that Bitcoin is going to zero, and on the other side you have financial experts that are projecting that someday a single Bitcoin will be worth one million dollars.\\n\\nI don’t know which side will ultimately prevail, but it will be a lot of fun to watch how everything plays out.\\n\\nMichael Snyder is a Republican candidate for Congress in Idaho’s First Congressional District, and you can learn how you can get involved in the campaign on his official website.

       " ('Black leather, tattoos and jeans are the proper Sunday worship attire at a Virginia biker church that meets in a former troubled bar. Opening its doors to 55 worshippers, Sunday marked the first service in the building formerly used for late-night drinking and clubbing.\\n\\nSeven Cities Freedom Bikers Church (SCFBC) in Chesapeake, Va., is home to bikers who share a common love for motorcycles and Jesus. They call the Bible their \"Owner\\'s Manual for life\" and they ride for Christ\\'s sake on the open road. Blakely\\'s Nightclub is the former bar that the church now uses for Sunday worship services, and much like many of the bikers\\' lives, the bar is also transformed.\\n\\nAssociate Pastor Max Rawls told The Christian Post in an interview Monday that the new location for the church is \"pretty cool.\" Rawls went on to say that the location is \"turning into something that is for good. Bikers are known for negative things and we are taking a building that was used for negative and using it for good. We are doing something that is kingdom minded.\"\\n\\nSCFBC began its search for a new facility on Craigslist, looking for a building they could call home for their small, growing congregation that is associated with the Sothern Baptist Convention. The pastors were looking for a building that they could expand and not have to move due to growth in two years or so.\\n\\nThe owner of the building that housed the former bar took the church leadership on a tour of the run- down building that had been closed for the last two years. Once inside, they saw leftovers from the last party, but also saw potential. They knew that this was the location for their church. The potential outweighed the current state it was in, they thought.\\n\\nAt SCFBC, there are worshippers who had patronized the facility back when it was a bar, and this is one of the reasons why Rawls is so excited. \"It\\'s fun to see them come back and help with the clean-up and the painting. It just shows the transformation in their lives too,\" Rawls explained.\\n\\nOn the first Thursday of every month, the church goes out to biker bars and cooks hotdogs for the bikers as an outreach. During riding season they go out for rides with the bikers. \"We just try to consistently be a light in a dark place,\" Rawls emphasized.\\n\\nOutreach is the biggest reason why \"Seven Cites\" was chosen as the church name. It represents the seven cities that the church is surrounded by and the hope that residents of all these cities will be members of the congregation. Rawls said, \"I am a former student of Wave Leadership College here in the area. The church is in the Chesapeake area but we are also near Norfolk, Virginia Beach and Hampton. We don\\'t want to just limit our outreach to only one of those seven cities.\"\\n\\nThe church professes to welcome anyone, regardless of if they are a biker or not. Responding to the commonly asked question of whether or not a visitor or member has to ride or own a motorcycle, they responded, \"Of course not! Maybe you will never ride, you\\'re still welcomed to join us. Just remember our vision and passion is to reach the motorcycle community. We are all about real relationship with Jesus Christ, and are passionate about the open road.\"\\n\\nSCFBC\\'s mission states that they are bikers reaching bikers, going out into the world, with the message of \"real\" freedom in Jesus Christ. Their motto is freedom according to John 8:36, \"If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.\"\\n\\nThere are currently 13 biker churches affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention. SCFBC\\'s new location has the potential to hold 600 people and they plan to do a full launch to invite area bikers within the next month. The church holds \"Hangout Time\" at 10am and the \"Worship Rally\" at 10:30am on Sundays.',\n",

Bloggers seemingly break more news, do more investigative journalism, produce high quality audio and video, and fill a void that newspapers are no longer able to fill. As ad revenue has shrunk, reporting staffs at newspapers across the nation have been slashed, and circulation is shrinking. All while consumers have an ever growing appetite for news, amplified by the instant access of social media.

       " ('Both WaPo and Newsweek have stories out on CIA’s role in assassinating Imad Mugniyah in 2008. As described, Michael Hayden loved the idea, but then got a bit squeamish about ordering a hit. Luckily, President Bush was all too happy to approve it. Here’s Newsweek:\\n\\n“General Hayden, at first, was all for this,” the former official said, “But slowly, or maybe not so slowly, the realization set in for him that he was ordering an assassination, that basically he was putting out a hit. And once he became pretty much cognizant of the fact that he was basically ordering the murder of someone, he got cold feet. He didn’t fancy himself as a Corleone.” And he wasn’t, really. That role would ultimately fall to the president. “Obviously [Hayden] had to get authority for this, and authority could come from only one person, and that would be POTUS,” said the participant. “So he went down to see President Bush. It took Bush apparently only about 30 seconds to say, ‘Yes, and why haven’t you done this already? You have my blessing. Go with God.’” [snip] But in late December, with the bomb ready and Mugniyah firmly in their sights, Hayden “started to get really cold feet again,” the participant said. He decided to go see President Bush personally—on Christmas Eve 2007, at Camp David. “On Christmas Eve morning, he and [Deputy CIA Director Steven] Kappes fly up to Camp David to see POTUS, to say, ‘Okay, look, here’s what we got, everything is in place, do we still have the go-ahead?’ And POTUS basically threw both of them out, saying, ‘Why are you up here wasting my time on Christmas Eve? Get the fuck out and go do this. Not quite in those terms. But it was, ‘Yes, I’ve already given you my approval. Go do this; go with God.’”\\n\\n“Go with our Christian God,” I guess Bush meant.\\n\\nBoth pieces emphasize how careful the CIA and Mossad were with their terrorist tactics, to make sure only their target was killed. Again, Newsweek:\\n\\nFinally, the car was in place. But then there were always other people around. Weeks more went by. Hayden’s demands that only Mugniyah be killed, and no one else, with no collateral damage, had to be met. “It was always either he wasn’t alone, or he had his kids with him, or somebody else with him, or there were casuals in the area, or he was gone, he was in the Bekka [Valley] or someplace else, he wasn’t in his apartment,” the participant said. “The rules of engagement were so tight that he probably walked past the thing dozens of times but they just couldn’t do anything because somebody was there or it just didn’t fit into the rules of engagement.” “They were keeping watch on this just about all the time,” he added. “They were taking shifts, a station officer and a Mossad officer. The Mossad officer was there just to make the confirmation that, ‘yeah, that’s him.’” The kill was made all the harder by the way the bomb would be detonated. There was a two-second delay from the time the CIA and Mossad agents in the lookout post pushed the button to when the bomb exploded. Under the plan, the Mossad agent would ID Mugniyah, and the CIA man would press the remote control. “So you would have to count—one, one thousand; two, one thousand… “ the participant said. “They had about six seconds from the time he came out of the apartment door to the time he moved out of the danger zone. So they had to do it really fast.”\\n\\nAnd WaPo notes how tedious it was to get approval to kill a guy whose attacks on the US were years earlier, under Reagan.\\n\\nFormer U.S. officials, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation, asserted that Mughniyah, although based in Syria, was directly connected to the arming and training of Shiite militias in Iraq that were targeting U.S. forces. There was little debate inside the Bush administration over the use of a car bomb instead of other means. “Remember, they were carrying out suicide bombings and IED attacks,” said one official, referring to Hezbollah operations in Iraq. [snip] The authority to kill Mughniyah required a presidential finding by President George W. Bush. The attorney general, the director of national intelligence, the national security adviser and the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department all signed off on the operation, one former intelligence official said. The former official said getting the authority to kill Mughniyah was a “rigorous and tedious” process. “What we had to show was he was a continuing threat to Americans,” the official said, noting that Mughniyah had a long history of targeting Americans dating back to his role in planning the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut. “The decision was we had to have absolute confirmation that it was self-defense,” the official said.\\n\\n(Note, Newsweek says the Finding was signed under Reagan, which actually makes more sense since the Gloves Come Off Memorandum of Notification Bush and Obama have relied on was also a modification of a Finding signed by him.)\\n\\nThis is, presumably, meant to be a big success story for CIA. My hope, however, is that it adds some nuance to debates about our use of drones. If the US kills more collateral casualties using drones than using a classic terrorist technique — in both cases making really attenuated claims about current threats — which is the greatest terror technique?\\n\\nUpdate: Kevin Jon Heller argues the US violated the Terrorist Bombing Convention.',\n",
